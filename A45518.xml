            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Humbly preſent to your honours this acknowledgement (in which God is my record, that I confidently and verily believe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:32682:7"/>the Charge I have Exhibited againſt Leivt. Col. <hi>Aſhfield,</hi> is both really true, and probable by good and ſuficient proof and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:) I confeſs I am not skilful in proceedings of ſtrife and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as having ever ſought peace, and therefore I might erre in order and manner of ſuch matters; but I look upon the truth of God (in this confeſſion, that Charge, and all other relations) as the Rod of God in <hi>Moſes</hi> hand, which (when he caſt it from him) tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into a Serpent, and he ſled from it: If I caſt away the Truth, and flee from it, it is a Serpent to deſtroy me, and to deſtroy ſuch as caſt it away and flee from it: If we take it up and hold it faſt, it is the Rod of God to bring us from a Land of burdens under War, Violence, and Oppreſſion, into a Kingdom wherein dwelleth Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs: What is abſolute truth, God knoweth; what I believe is really true, and probable by ſuficient witneſs I here aſſert. What can or ſhall appear, I leave to God to diſcover, and to juſt men to diſcern and judge: I know no preſident in the Army, comparable to me, for wrongs and unjuſt ſufferings; and I believe there is none, nor hath been any, therefore I made my humble Addreſſes to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Repreſentatives, but without Redreſs and in vain: My humble Deſires in the ſaid Addreſſes chiefty were, That two men of approved fidelity (whom I on my part ſhould chuſe) as the Lievt. Col. on his part might have the ſame liberty) might be appointed and authoriſed with power to take Examinations, and either to decide and end all Differences and Grievances, or Report them, (as the beſt expedient to Truth and Peace), and this Was my humble Deſire to the Court Martial. I gave the Charge to the Judge Advocate, in his Chamber, and askt him if I muſt ſet the names of the Witneſſes in the Margent? he ſaid, No: and gave it me back to alter ſomething in it: The next morning I gave it him in his Chamber, and he gave it me back, biding me give it him into the Court, which I did; I told the Court, I would prove the Charge by ſufficient witneſs, and Declare to what he could alledge againſt it, and deſired that my witneſſes might be ſent unto to be Examined; but the Court did not admit me that liberty, but Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered I ſhould acknowledge at the Head of the Regiment, That I had wronged the ſaid Lievt. Col. and that ſhould be all my puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: I Anſwered, I could not do it; not out of contempt to the Court, but becauſe I was cleerly convinced in Conſcience, That I
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:32682:8"/>had done him no wrong in that Charge: The Court there upon Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered I ſhould be ſuſpended <hi>14.</hi> dayes, in which time if I did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge I had done him wrong, I ſhould be Caſhiered. The Cauſes why I Exhibited that Charge, are, Firſt, becauſe I do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believe, and am ſatisfied in Conſcience, That that intire Charge for the ſubſtance of it) and much more, is really true; and that he was the firſt cauſer and mover of that ſtrife. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I did verily beleive that from the time of the ſaid Regiments firſt Engaging with the Army, (about the time the Army enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at <hi>New-Market</hi>-Heath) the ſaid Lievt. Col. did labour to work out, wrong, and ſuppreſs, the honeſt Party of the Garriſons of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and <hi>Tinmouth</hi> Caſtle, to the extream hazard of the ſaid Garriſons: And I verily believe alſo that this was the Senſe of the honeſt party, and of thoſe that had Engaged in the ſaid Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons. Thirdly, Becauſe as <hi>David</hi> (a good man and a wiſe King) having wronged <hi>Vriah,</hi> did from that Principle, improve all his power in himſelf, and all the power and intereſt in the Captain of his Hoſt to deſtroy that man, and he did deſtroy him. So it is cleer to me that he having wronged the honeſt party, and thoſe that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged with the Army, in theſe Garriſons, muſt (and did) from that Principle, improve his own power, and all his power and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, in and with other Officers and Commanders, to engage them unto him, to work out, wrong, and ſuppreſs the honeſt party, and ſuch as did engage, and thereby did extremly hazard to deſtroy the Army by moſt unjuſt Oppreſſions, and continual Rents, and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. I am free in Spirit, that being convinced in Conſcience that this and much more, and that Charge is true: I had been guilty of betraying my Faith, and Truſt, had I not made Diſcovery of it; and for this cauſe for Conſcience ſake, becauſe I will not, nor can againſt my Conſcience, betray my Faith, and deny the Truth, am I cenſured to be Caſhiered: <hi>Naboth</hi> was ſtoned to death, yet not without teſtimony of two witneſſes, though men of <hi>Belial.</hi> I am deprived of the price of my bloud, for ſeven yeers faithful ſervice, and in it of the Symbol and Staff of my native, and acquiſite ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and maintenance, becauſe I will not, nor in Conſcience can, reject the Record of God, witneſſing the Truth, being Plaintiffe my ſelf, having no witneſs for me, nor againſt me, that I ſaw, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding none, nor any Tryal then, and at that time, but to deſire aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:32682:8"/>of the Court, to order a right way, that my proofs and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs might be received and examined, not doubting but to make good the Charge, having the liberty of requiſite and lawful time and means to do it. <hi>Jotham</hi> put his Life in his hand to hazard it, that he might diſcharge his Truſt to the men of <hi>Sechem</hi> and <hi>Milo</hi> that they might not be deſtroyed, ſaying, <hi>Harken to me you men of</hi> Sechem, <hi>that God may harken unto you:</hi> yet they did not har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and therefore were deſtroyed, Man, Woman, and Child, and their City was ſown with Salt. All Iſrael put their Lives in their hands, to hazard them, that they might diſcharge their Faith and Truſt to <hi>Benjamin,</hi> that they might harken to do righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not be deſtroyed; but they did not harken, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were deſtroyed, Man, Woman, and Child; and they that did not oppoſe them, and help to deſtroy them, were likewiſe deſtroyed: Not I, but many of us (not once, but many times) have put our Lives in our hands, to hazard them, that we might diſcharge our Faith and Truſt to ſeveral Repreſentatives, in our many hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Addreſſes to them, That they might do righteous judgment, and not be deſtroyed; but they have not harkned. And I am free in Spirit, and in Conſcience convicted, That this hath been, and is the only main Cauſe of all the War, Bloud, and Deſtruction upon this Nation; and will be the Deſtruction of the Army and it, if God do not encline the ſaid Repreſentatives hearts, and Yours, to harken to do righteous judgment, that God may harken to You and this Nation. To harken is better then fatt of Rams, but ſuddain haſte of raſh Cenſure in Judgement, to judge any thing before the time, or any man unheard, is to diſobey and reject the Voice of God, and hath no concord with that ſoft and ſtill voice, which is of God, and in which God is: What I have oft done to divers of you, I do at this time to all of you; that is, I put my Life in my hand, to hazard it, that I may diſcharge my Faith and Truſt to your Honors, and I muſt be free in diſcharge of it. <hi>Joſephs</hi> Brethren, brought his Coat, rent, torn, and bloudy, to his Father, and ſaid, See, is this thy Sons Coat, or no?

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:32682:11"/>greateſt wrongs done to the State, and to private Perſons, without being admitted to have any witneſs heard, or tryal had.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Conſider the tranſcendent miſery of the Army and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (the honeſt party eſpecially) who when wronged and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, may not approach a Repreſentative or Court of Juſtice for Juſtice, without inevitable peril of being deſtroyed for ſo doing,</p>
            <p n="5">5. Conſider the extreme miſery of the disbanded, ſick, and wounded Souldiers, deprived of the price of their lives, their due pay in Arrears, which countervails not their pains in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after it; for want of which, many thouſands have miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably periſhed, and do periſh. Secondly, Conſider that theſe miſeries upon them, and the poor, and the middle ſort of people, are exceedingly augmented, and occaſioned by the Souldiers quartering in Cities and Market-Towns, eſpecially in Inns and Ale-houſes, where the Souldiers learn looſe converſation, and waſte the ſhort pittance of their ſlender pay. Thirdly, By means of their quartering in Cities and Market-Towns, the Country being free, enhanceth and almoſt doubleth the price of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, whereby a general ſcarcity and famine is procured. Fourthly, By means of this ſcarcity, the Souldiers and the poor of the Nation, but the disbanded Souldiers, and the poor of Cities and Market-Towns eſpecially, periſh for want of food and rayment. Fourthly, By this means the middle ſort, and Tradeſ-men of Cities and Market-Towns, being alſo over-bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened with Taxes, Exciſe, and Quartering, and not having tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding nor viſible Eſtates, are forced to become ſuddenly extreme poor; and which is worſt, the remedy of all theſe evils, is the root of the diſeaſe; that is, they that ſhould redreſs all theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, are the cauſe of them: To redreſs which, and to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way this cauſe of all the reſt,</p>
            <p>Sixtly, Conſider the many intolerable incumbrances inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to Repreſentatives and Courts of Juſtice, through their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Adminiſtrations, and multiplicity of buſineſs; whereby, if any of them deſire to do Juſtice, and to redreſs the cruelties and oppreſſions which the Souldiers, the middle fort, and the poor of the Nation ſuffer; yet they cannot do it, becauſe they are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged and incumbred with more buſineſs then they may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:32682:12"/>diſcharge; amongſt whom, all juſt cauſes of all ſorts of people, and of the poor, are like good ſeed ſown amongſt thorns, that choke it. So that while they are buſied, <hi>Martha</hi>-like, about many things, they muſt of neceſſity omit in all things, the only one thing neceſſary; which is, To do righteous Judgement. By this means War and Deſtruction hath bin, and is continued up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Nation; and the people every where periſh for want of their proper food (the fruit of the Tree of Life) which is Juſtice and Righteouſneſs. For remedy hereof, and to take from Courts and Repreſentatives this burden, which they can no more bear, then a new born child can bear the weight of a Mill-ſtone, let the order and method of going to Law after the manner of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, be (what may be) declined and abrogated; and let the Rule of God in the Goſpel, to end all Differences, and ceaſe ſtrife, be ſtrictly obſerved and followed.</p>
            <p>The manner of going to Law as Heathens, is when two or more at variance betwixt themſelves, cannot judge their own cauſe, but go to a corrupt Repreſentative or Court for Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that hath no judgement, or that hath leſs judgement then themſelves, becauſe it knows leſs of their buſineſs, and hath no leiſure or time, neither will or can have leiſure to apprehend the true grounds and cauſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They that are ſet to judge any matters of difference, muſt not maintain a difference where the buſineſs may be juſtly compoſed in peace; nor move unto peace, where there is real cauſe of difference, and where Peace with Truth cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled. If one or two cannot end any matter of difference, let them bring it into fit Series and Order for further tryal, and let the diſ ſatisfied parties adde for each, one or two more: If two or three for each cannot end it, then let the diſ-ſatisfied parties chuſe a Repreſentative, conſiſting of twelve men, and a Preſident freely and equally choſen for, and by each; and let the two or three firſt choſen, having ſuccinctly ſtated the buſineſs, tranſmit it to the Select Repreſentative, and be in, and of the ſaid Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative themſelves: If the Select Repreſentative cannot end the difference, the diſ-ſatisfied partys may have liberty to Appeal to a more general Repreſentative, and the Select Repreſentative is to refer and tranſmit the Order of the buſineſs, and of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in it, to the more general Repreſentative.</p>
            <p>By this means all matters of difference in all places, will be (by the Chriſtian wiſdom and prudence of a few perſons) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, the ſeeds and roots of Sedition eradicated and deſtroyed; and War, and the miſeries of it, prevented and ended.</p>

            <p>If any difference be betwixt perſon and perſon, or betwixt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or perſons, and any Repreſentative, or betwixt Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Repreſentative, Court and Court, they (being parties one againſt another) cannot be Judges of, or Witneſſes one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another; or, if they aſſume that power, to be proceeded againſt, as uſurpers over the perſons, lives, and liberties of the Free-born people.</p>
            <p>But whether the difference be betwixt man and man, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a man and any Repreſentative, or Court, (ſelect, ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, or more general) they are to chuſe perſons, or Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives

Good and juſt Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtees, conjunct in bodies Repreſentative, are like Trees of Life; which by their good fruits of Juſtice and Righteouſneſs, ſuſtain and preſerve alive their reſpective bodies repreſented.

            <p>Truſtees that ſhed innocent bloud, or ſhed not their bloud tdatare guilty of bloud, are murderers: All oppreſſions, wrongs, cruelties, and unjuſt actions, are degrees and ſpecies of real bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and murder; and they uſually differ from viſible and expreſs man-ſlaughter or murder no otherwiſe, then as the wickedneſs of hypocriſie differs from viſible and apparent ſin; For it was all one for <hi>David</hi> to have ſlain <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> with his own ſword, or with the ſword of the Ammonites, onely that had a better colour of hypocriſie: So it is all one to ſlay the poor, and the middle ſort of people, and the Souldiers by immediate ſtroke of violence, or to ſlay them by oppreſſion, or by extorting from them unjuſtly, that which ſhould maintain their lives, or by needleſs delays of doing right, or by keeping back their proper eſtates, pay, and juſt intereſts; onely this hath a better colour of hypocriſie: So it is all one to kill the conſcientious and honeſt party, or others (as <hi>Doeg</hi> did the Prieſts of the Lord) by immediate violence, or to kill them by oppreſſions or impriſonment; or as <hi>Naboth</hi> was, by falſe witneſſes, or by ſtarving and famiſhing of them: onely this hath a fairer pretenſe, and better colour of hypocriſie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is more wicked. And thoſe Truſtees that either in Counſel or Execution do act or commit ſuch things, are Law-breakers (as perſons) and betrayers of their Truſt (as Repreſentatives) and embrue the hands of the Nation, and their own, in the deepeſt guilt of bloud. Therefore all Plaintiffs and Witneſſes that know certainly any oppreſſion, cruelty, or unjuſt actions done unto, or by any perſon, the Nation, or themſelves, muſt (as Truſtees) faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſcharge their Conſciences to God, and duties to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and Nation, to free it and themſelves from guilt of bloud, and breach of the Law; and to free themſelves from breach of Truſt; and that in the cauſe of any, and of every particular and

            <p>Ninthly, And therefore the Law (that is equity) and the juſt miniſters of it, need not, nor do, nor can admit of any unjuſt or corrupt connivances, indulgencies, or indempnities whatſoever. <hi>Adam</hi> when he had ſinned, and ſaw himſelf naked, ſought Fig-leaves to cover his nakedneſs; So let them that break the Law, and that betray and deſtroy it, and thoſe that ſtand to maintain it; ſeek unjuſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Tenthly, That all Repreſentatives for their own juſtification and ſecurity, and ſatisfaction of all men; keep a complete and perfect record of all their Decrees and Executions, expreſſing the whole ſeries of all their proceedings, and the Votes of every particular perſon of their Repreſentative, their names, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of reſidence, and the particular examinations of every wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with their names, and place of reſidence: Theſe Records to be atteſted by two or three men of known integrity, under their hands; men (if it may be) no way concerned in the cauſe, nor engaged to any parties that do try, or are tryed; and that the parties tryed may have (if they deſire it) Copies of the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives whole proceedings (as aforeſaid) ſo atteſted. For it was no ſatisfaction as to the aſſoylment of <hi>Ahab</hi> by the Elders of Iſrael from the bloud of <hi>Naboth,</hi> that <hi>Naboth</hi> was put to death by a wicked Repreſentative through falſe witneſs: Alſo that the evidence of men of Pharaſaical and bloudy Spirits, common Barretters, and men of Belial, and ſuch as manifeſt looſneſs, and little or no Conſcience in their converſations, may not be eaſily admitted in Judgement, eſpecially againſt men of known ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty and integrity: Let their teſtimony be circumſpectly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, and if their evidence upon due examination be found falſe, let them ſuffer the ſame puniſhment which had bin due to the defender, if their witneſs had bin true.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Conſider the wrong, and abuſe done to the Souldiers, and Nation, in not paying the Souldiers, at disbanding, their full and total due for their Service, eſpecially in disbanding ſome without

Secondly, the Nation is hereby made guilty of moſt unnatural ingratitude of extenſive horror and vaſtneſs.

Sixthly, Conſider that a Debenter is but a titular, and no real Intereſt, and ſatisfies not the Nations, and Peoples, nor the Souldiers juſt intereſt, in relation to the Freedom of the Nation, from the ſlain of guilt that lies upon it, and in relation to the Souldiers in point of Right.

A ſingle man in ordinary health, may eat eight pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worth of bread and wholſom meat (as rates are) at one meal, and yet be forc'd to drink water with it: But a Souldiers clothes, and linen, and waſhing, and reparations, and ſhoes, and ſtockings, (if he order himſelf in any wholſom or ſeemly manner) will coſt him 4 d <hi>per diem,</hi> throughout the yeer: So then, he hath 4 d a day to find him, which (as rates are) is not ſo much as 2 d a day was formerly, and which is not ſufficient for one Souldier, to afford him half of one good meal in a day, through the year, and yet this muſt maintain his Wife and Family alſo, if he have any. And becauſe this pittance, (too ſhort for any priſoner) is too much for a S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:32682:16"/>conceived, and directly and wholy againſt all humanity, much more againſt Chriſtian equity, integrity and goodneſs. The Souldiers of Horſe and Foot are Free-born Engliſh, and not Native Bondſlaves: Slavery and Bondage in corporal and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. Corporal Bondage is a ſubduing and bringing under of the Body by ſore labor, and ſervile work, or watchings, not afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing food and rayment ſufficient to bear up the body in its labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thrall. Spiritual bondage is co-incident to Corporal bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; For as a corrupt veſſel corrupteth what is contained in it, ſo the bodies of the Souldiers, brought low by many ſurfets, through ſundry conſtant hard ſervices, wearied with often watchings and ill accomodations, lamed and broken with bruiſes, wounds, heats, hunger, cold, aches, and often ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, filled with all ſerdes, and filth of lothſom poverty and nakedneſs, renders their Spirits ſlaviſh and abject, their perſons deſperate, and careleſs of themſelves and families, and them and their families debauched and wicked, and ready and prone to purſue raſh and unjuſt courſes, which caſt them upon the mercies of their Repreſentatives, who condemn and caſhier them; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of their juſt and neceſſary livelihood, the ſtaff of their lives, and bridle which ſhould reſtrain them from wickedneſs; and they deprive many of life alſo. Want is Vertues clog, and the moſt violent ſpur and provocation to all wickedneſs: It fits men for all vaſſallage and ſlavery: It puts out the eys of reaſon, and renders mens minds brutiſh; It ſubjects their Spirits to all ſervile wickedneſs, and their Bodies to all unjuſt burdens of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral calamities and miſeries; It maketh Souldiers ſlaves to bloudy Deſignes, Vaſſals of baſe and wicked enterpriſes, to kill (if commanded or not commanded) one another, or their beſt friends, and to engage in bloud againſt any, or againſt all the Free-born People, to deſtroy them. Extreme and unjuſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty cauſed by cruel oppreſſion, is the iron chain of curſed bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, which makes men ſlaves to other mens wills, and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; Slaves to their own ſins, ſlaves to all miſeries, ſlaves to their own utter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:32682:17"/>to redreſs their wrongs and oppreſſions, bring the guilt of the bloud of the poor, and of the Nation, upon themſelves, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Nation.</p>
            <p>The poor of the Nation (for the moſt part) are Souldiers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done in ſervice, turn'd out, and deprived of their proper Rights, the price of their bloud: Many of the Nation are made poor in purſuing their, and the Peoples Rights and Liberties; and the reſt of the poor (for the moſt part) are ſuch as are undone, by ſlavery and oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>I mention theſe things for no other purpoſe, but that the bloud-guilty defilement of the Land, if poſſible, may be purged from it; and for redreſs of it, I propoſe, Firſt, that the Foot may have 12. d. <hi>per diem,</hi> from the begining of the Service (as was promiſed) or as due by a better right, the juſt claim of Equity and Neceſſity; Why ſhould the Souldiers eat aſhes, and be clothed in rags by thoſe for whom they have purchaſed by their hazard and bloud, to be clothed in Scarlet, and to eat the fat of the Land. Secondly, That the conſtant future pay for the Foot, be (at leaſt and when things are as cheap as they have bin) twelve pence <hi>per diem;</hi> and that their preſent and future pay be (as rates of all proviſions are now, and may be) ſo much above twelve pence <hi>per diem,</hi> as may competently maintain them and their charge in due health with honeſty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That Troopers and Dragoons may have 2. s 6. d <hi>per diem,</hi> from the begining of the Service: and for future, what more may juſtly countervail their neceſſities; the deerneſs and ſcarcity of all things conſidered.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the ſick and wounded Horſe and Foot, that for that cauſe are out of Service, may have the ſame pay that they in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice have, but not pay for horſes except they keep horſes for the Service. The Souldiers when ſick and wounded, have moſt need of their pay, and they beſt deſerve it, who (in diſcharge of their faithfulneſs) have ſuffered moſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That the ſick and wounded Officers may the ſame pay which they had in ſervice, it being extreme hard, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt meaſure, that they or the Souldiers ſhould be then moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute, when they have moſt need; or that their faithfulneſs (wherein they have hazarded their lives, and bin wounded)

            <p n="6">6.

            <p>Eighthly, For relieving of the reſt of the poor, and for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of the middle ſort of people from extream poverty and beggary, Let every pariſh be brought into a Body repreſented, and conſtitute a Repreſentative and Repreſentators of its own in its ſelf. Let the body repreſented, Conveen as oft as there ſhall be juſt cauſe: the body Repreſentative (if need be) every week. Let the end of the Conveening of the body repreſented, and of the body repreſentative, be (eſpecially at firſt) to determine who are the poor of that body that muſt be relieved, and how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. Secondly, Who are the middle ſort that cannot relieve, and need not be relieved. And Thirdly, who are the rich that may relieve and bear ſome burden, and what burden they may bear towards the diſcharge of the Debts of the Nation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the poor.</p>
            <p>The poor are to be relieved by having all Commons, Fennes, Forreſts, Parks, and donations of Houſes, Lands, and Monies that have been anciently their due, reſtored to them, and a ſtock of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:32682:19"/>cattel raiſed for them to improve it for their maintenance. They that cannot improve Land or Cattel by their labour, are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by being ſet at work, and what they want of ſufficiency to relieve them by their labour, muſt be allowed by Contributions.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The middle ſort that cannot relieve, and need not relief; and the poor muſt be freed from all burdens, that they may the better provide for, and maintain their own Families: and to this end, let Exciſe and Tythes be taken off from all. 2 Where Tythes have been bought, let juſt recompence be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Buyer (if it may be) by the Seller, and let the Seller in like manner require his ſatisfaction. 3 The conſiderations and original grounds upon which Tythes were firſt granted by the people, are to be conſidered: If they were at firſt freely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed and granted by the people, and not extorted: and if the conſiderations and grounds upon which they were demiſed and graunted, were (in thoſe times) viſibly juſt, and equal; then there is ſome reaſon they ſhould be re-bought by the people (they not paying more then what the buyer paid.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Let all Taxes, Seſſements, and Quartering be taken off from the poor and middle ſort of people, and let their Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords bear their burden.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Let no Farmers pay any Taxes or Seſſements, nor bear any burden of Free-Quarter, or otherwiſe, in relation to the Land they Rent: For Free Quarter is not, nor can be quite ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, as Rates of Proviſions are, and the Souldiers Pay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Let no Souldiers Quarter in Cities and Market-Towns, which cauſeth ſcarcity and famine in the Land, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes the poor and middle ſort of people.</p>
            <p>Repreſentors of every Pariſh are to be but two; their Office is to ſee, and provide that the poor and middle ſort of people (whoſe Repreſentors they are) be not oppreſſed, or deprived of their juſt Rights, and to obtain them (where wanting) that all due adminiſtrations of Right and Juſtice be extended to all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and to decide and end all differences, and cauſe ſtrife to ceaſe in their reſpective Pariſhes, without going to Law, as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, to deſtroy one another.</p>
            <p>To compleate a perfect Repreſentative in every Pariſh, let
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:32682:20"/>eleven or twelve more be added to the two Repreſentors to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the ſame Office with them where they have firſt done their endeavours, and cannot determine or end any difference. Let every compleat Repreſentative conſiſt of twelve men, and a Preſident. Let their Repreſentors (eſpecially) and alſo the body Repreſentative be men fearing God, dealing truly, and hating Covetouſneſs; haters of Oppreſſion, enemies to Vſurpers, and Oppreſſors, impartial to all, free from Phariſaical bloudy rigour, and lovers and approvers of the Nations and Armies juſt Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the Nations Freedom, and the juſt Liberties and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of all perſons. If two or twelve ſo qualified cannot be found in ſome Pariſhes, then they are to joyn with ſome other Pariſh or Pariſhes, until ſo many may be found. No perſon, or grieved parties ſhall be tyed to refer their grievances to the ſaid two, or twelve, unleſs they freely chuſe them themſelves; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they may equally and freely chuſe any other two or twelve. Every perſon in every Repreſented, and Repreſentative, may freely give his Vote and Advice; but if the Sentence and Reſult be recented as unjuſt, their ſufferage, and Voyce only, that are known to be conſcientious and qualified as aforeſaid, ſhall ſtand; and the Voyces of others, though never ſo rich and powerful uſurpers and oppreſſors, be of no force. Two Repreſentors in every Pariſh (elected by the Repreſented, or by the poor and middle ſort of people in it) may (by the approbation and aſſent of their reſpective poor and middle ſort of people) chuſe two for the County or Shire to perform the like Offices to the poor and middle ſort of people of the Shire or County. Alſo two Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentors (choſen in every Shire or County) may (by approbation and aſſent of their reſpective Parochial Repreſentors, and of the middle ſort of people and poor of the Nation) chuſe and appoint two Repreſentors (for the middle ſort of people, and poor of the Nation) who (being fitly qualified) may reduce the ſad and afflicted condition of the poor and middle ſort of people into an expeditious and right order of ſpeedy and effectual redreſs.</p>
            <p>Conſider that ſlavery is the moſt vile and miſerable condition, and blackeſt curſe, that is or can be incident to men; the bond of ſin and death to their bodies and ſpirits, the chain of deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Nation; and therefore it requires our earneſt care to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:32682:20"/>quit our ſelves and Nation from it. A Pillar of a cloud, and of fire, did direct Iſrael out of Aegyptian Bondage into the promiſed Land of Liberty. The light and truth of God in the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Spirits of men, is that real and true Pillar of fire, which all free-born people of God do and muſt follow; That was outward, this inward: That gave light to the Body, this to the Spirit. God (in, and by that Pillar of fire) led and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Iſrael (<hi>Abrahams</hi> Free-born) from their chains of cruel bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, into their land of promiſed liberty. God (in and by this Pillar of light, and fire, in the judgements and Spirits of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) leadeth and delivereth his Free-born, from real bondage of body and ſpirit, (under all burdens of bloudy guilt, and cruel op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions) into the land of promiſed peace, truth, and perfect free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Iſrael moved not but after that cloud by day; and moved and did all things by night, in and by the light of that pillar of fire. So the Free-born of God (in the Army and Nation) muſt in all their motions and actings, follow after, and act in, and by the light of the Pillar of God (the pillar of light and truth in their own Spirits:) They muſt not ſell or enſlave their own or others lives, light, liberties, intereſts, bodies, and ſpirits, to ſerve (under all barbarous calamities, and bloudy wickedneſs of blind obedience) the vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eſt vaſſals of ſlavery, as the ſons of <hi>Jacob</hi> ſold their brother, the preſerver of their lives and beings, into the houſe of bondage. They muſt (in all their motions and actions) walk and act in the liberty of the light of God in their own ſpirits: and not act or acquieſce from principles of an implicite-faith in the Arbytrarie commands of will and power in any Repreſentative or perſon whatſoever. It is ſmall ſatisfaction or ſecurity to any man (that may ſee if he will, but will follow and be led by a blind man, till both fall into a ditch and periſh) to think to ſay for himſelf a blind man led him, and it was his own will, and he would be led by him. So if any ſub-Officers, Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, or others, ſhall execute any unjuſt decree by order of or from any Commanders or Repreſentatives whatſoever, the plea of their order were weak, and without all ſatisfaction. They muſt not think their Officers command (if unjuſt) can free them or their Officers from the juſt doom and due penalty of the Law, no more then a murderers plea at the Bar, that his fellow robber
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:32682:21"/>commanded him to kill the murdered, can quit him or his fellow from guilt of murder, or from death due to murderers. Neither may any perſon or perſons, or Repreſentatives, Courts, or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, vainly conceive that any impoſed Truſt, Place, or Office, or perſonal Eminency, or that their being many, is or can be of any force to free them (more then any one privat mean man) from due puniſhment, though it be death which the Law inflicteth for, breach of it; or to free any perſon or perſons whom they employ, from the like puniſhments. Howbeit the Free-born of God in Army or Nation, Officers, Souldiers, or private men, that groan under the curſed burdens of bloudy wickedneſs, and barbarous oppreſſions which they have born themſelves, or laid upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, if they ſeek earneſtly, and effectually endeavour the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of their bodies and ſpirits; and to free others from the ſame bondage (whereof the Iſraelites bondage in Aegypt and deliveranoe out of it was but a type and ſhaddow) may, and ought to be in ſome meaſure commiſerated; and their cruelties time paſt, if utterly renounced, and really repented of, may be ſo far paſſed by, as the Law can admit: alſo ſome unjuſt actions o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> infirmity and weakneſs, ſo far only as may ſtand with law and equity, may be born withal.</p>
            <p>God keeps not the children of light in chains of darkneſs, but willeth that all men ſhould be ſaved from curſed ſervitude, and bondage of body and ſpirit, by coming unto, and following af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the pillar of God, the knowledge of the Truth in their own Judgements and Spirits; and that they walk and act at all times and in all relations, in the light of this pillar of fire within them, Wherefore let all the Free-born of God in the Army and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, caſt off the wicked burdens of curſed and blind obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Repreſentatives Arbytrarie commands of Will and Power; and fix the eys of their underſtandings upon the pillar of God, in their own Judgements and Spirits: Let them ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider in and with themſelves, and with one another, the grounds of all their actions; engagements, and executions, and be well adviſed and ſatisfied in their Spirits, to what end, and where unto they tend; whether to liberty or bondage, light o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>That this pillar of Light and Truth may be more conſpicuous and apparent to all the free-born of the Army and Nation, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe firſt for the Army, That all Troops and Companies, ſelect and appoint (in each Troop of horſe, and Company of foot) two Repreſentors, men (if it may be) that have been ever firm to all the Armies and Nations juſt Intereſts, and Engagements; and faithful and wel-affected to the conſcientious and honeſt party in both; impartial to all; yet free from Phariſaical bloudy rigour, and indiſcreet raſhneſs: Let theſe ſit, and act in all Councels of their Regiments with thoſe Officers that concur with them in their Agreements, according to their juſt Engagements.

Without this or the like Order, the particular Bodies Repreſented, and their Repreſentatives, and the general Body Repreſented (the State) and its Repreſentatives, muſt ſit in darkneſs, and the ſhaddow of death, without guide of light, or pillar of truth to deliver them from the moſt execrable ſlavery of bondage, and miſery in body and Spirit; and both Army and Nation muſt remain a dead Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byloniſh Chaos of confuſion, darkneſs, and diſorder, without light or form. Let the Repreſentors of Troops and Companies, by concurrence and aſſent of their reſpective Repreſented, chuſe in every Regiment two Repreſentors for the Regiment to concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the work of many into unity, and to avoid confuſion.

            <p>They Level them by reducing their pay already due for their ſervice paſt, in deducting part for free Quarter, without ſhowing, or proving what, or how much, or to whom, or from whom in particular any part of it is due.</p>
            <p>They Level them by reducing the future, paſt, and preſent pay of the Horſe in general; and of divers Officers of Horſe and Foot, contrary to the Faith of this Nation, and their own juſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements.</p>

            <p>By this means the Faith of the Nation is groſſely abuſed, and perfidiouſly infringed and broken, and the Nation made guilty of defrauding, and of oppreſſing its preſervers; guilty of moſt unnatural cruelty and injuſtice; guilty of re-involving it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this laſt new War, wherein it was brought to the very brink of extremity to be utterly loſt and deſtroyed.</p>

            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Pharoah</hi> and his ſervants were ſet upon their wicked purpoſe to oppreſs, level, and deſtroy Iſrael, by believing the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words and works of Sorcerers: So theſe are ſet upon their wicked purpoſe, to oppreſs, level, and deſtroy the true Iſrael, by harkening to real Sorcerers, and ſeducers. The Sorcerers of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt reſiſted <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſent to deliver <hi>Abrahams</hi> free born from Egyptian bondage: Theſe reſiſt (the true <hi>Moſes</hi>) Chriſt, ſent to deliver the true Iſrael (the free born of God) from real miſery, and bondage, in body and Spirit.</p>
            <p>The works of God by <hi>Moſes,</hi> were true Miracles, real Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and types of true Righteouſneſs: For example, The Egyptians (thirſting the bloud of their ſuppoſed Levellers, but real Supporters) drowned their Males in rivers; therfore all rivers and waters of Egypt were turned to bloud, that they and their cattel could drink no water, but bloud: and this work of God by <hi>Moſes,</hi> was a work of true Righteouſneſs, and a type of a more perfect righteouſnes of (the true <hi>Moſes</hi>) Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The Fiſhes (which in theſe rivers are more various and monſtrous then in any rivers in the world) fed upon the fleſh and bloud of the Iſraelites new born infants: therefore in a type of Juſtice, the fiſhes had rivers of bloud given them, and nothing but bloud to drink and feed upon; therefore the fiſh died, and the rivers ſtank.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:32682:24"/> 3 The Egyptians regarded not the juſt Petitions, cryes, and complaints of the afflicted Iſraelites; nor the pitious cryes of their periſhing Male children whom they drown'd in the rivers: therefore Frogs, a helpleſs, naked, and unarmed; alſo a clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and crying creature, came up out of the Rivers into their houſes, and bed-chambers, and covered their Land as it were ſo many millions of witneſſes atteſting to their faces, and with loud voyces proclaiming their bloudy cruelties, and oppreſſions: As the naked and unarmed condition, and helpleſs innocence of the new born infants, caſt into theſe Rivers, was remonſtrant to the eyes of the Egyptians in this creature; ſo theſe creatures were a type of the helpleſs, and miſerably naked, and ſtript poor.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The Egyptians did eate up the afflicted poor of the Land like bread, and did grind them to duſt: therefore the duſt of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt (a type alſo of the poor) was turned into Lice, and did eate the fleſh of the Egyptians.</p>
            <p>Where the peoples Repreſentatives oppreſs and deſtroy the people of God; the plague of Frogs follows and innumerable helpleſs, and naked poor cover the Land, and fill the houſes and bed-chambers of their oppreſſors with loud clamours, petitions, cryes, and complaints.</p>
            <p>If oppreſſors will not hear the cryes of the people of God, nor of their miſerable murdered male children, nor the cryes of the poor; the plague of Lice follows, and the duſt of Egypt (the poor of the Land) turned into Lice, eate the fleſh of their oppreſſors. Their corruption and cruel oppreſſion bred them, and they muſt feed them.</p>
            <p>Theſe plagues, and all the reſt, were not upon <hi>Abrahams</hi> free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, the Iſraelites; but upon the Egyptians, their oppreſſors: And theſe plagues (in the truth and ſubſtance) will not fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe that in ſincerity ſeek Freedom from Bondage, but upon their oppreſſors, that ſeek to enſlave, level, and deſtroy them.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and all the Miracles which God wrought by <hi>Moſes,</hi> were true Miracles, and likewiſe works of real Juſtice, and types of true Righteouſneſs, tending to deliver Iſrael from the moſt bloudy and cruel bondage and oppreſſions that ever were.

            <p>The Reaſons and Ends of a general Addreſs of the Nation to, and with each other by joyn Remonſtrance for an Agreement of the Nation, by ſatisfying all juſt Intereſts, are, That all diſ-ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions and wrongs, the grounds of War and Deſtruction, may be ſpeedily and effectually Redreſſed in relation to the Middle ſort of people, and poor of the Nation. 2 To the Army. 3 To the Nation. 4 To all Perſons. Secondly, That the People (Military and Civil) ſtir up, and call upon (by joynt and mutual addreſs) one another in all wiſdom of meekneſs, to ſeek to inform, convince, and ſatisfie one another, and to be convinced and ſatisfied in their judgments and ſpirits in all things wherein the ſafety of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſatisfaction of all juſt Intereſts conſiſts: The Reaſons are, Firſt, That the Nation and Army may be freed from the perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious violations of their Faith and juſt Engagements to God, and man. 2 That they may be freed from the Nation ſins, and guilt of bloud; and the many imminent miſeries that are like to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Nation. 3 Becauſe, if any wrong be done, or ſin, or treſpaſs committed (whether againſt a mans-ſelf, or any other) there is a neceſſity from God laid upon that man, and upon every perſon that knows it, and upon the Nation (if it hath notice of it) to ſeek to Redreſs that wrong, ſin, or treſpaſs; and the whole Nation (if it be not otherwaſe Redreſſed) muſt joyn together, as one man, to Redreſs effectually that wrong, or ſin, though it be committed only by, or againſt one privat perſon, or family: Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſins (the vileſt and moſt unnatural) much more. Firſt, Becauſe that perſon, people, and Nation that knows any wrong done, or ſin, or trespaſs committed (though by, or againſt but one private perſon or family) and doth not ſeek effectually to redreſs it; commits it, and is guilty of it: and by making that Perſonal ſin (in not redreſſing of it) National, is guilty of it in that relation alſo.</p>
            <p>The Levite of Mount Epharim was but one private perſon, and the wrong which was done to him, and not redreſſed, was
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:32682:27"/>done only to him, and his private family: yet all Iſrael was ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together as one man unto the Lord at Miſpeh, and ſent men throughout the Tribe of <hi>Benjamine</hi> to convince it, and to be convinced what that wrong was, and to redreſs it; and to move <hi>Benjamine</hi> to joyn with them unto the Lord for redreſs of it: But that Tribe harkned not, and was therefore deſtroyed (600 excepted) man, woman, and child, with their cattel; and their Cities were fired; and God owned that Action.</p>
            <p>The wrong done to the Levites family was vile and wicked; yet in it ſelf a private wrong: but in <hi>Benjamine</hi> that did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs it, a Nation ſin derived upon it by that Tribe, from one wrong done to one ſingle private family.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nation</hi> ſins properly are theſe wrongs, treſpaſſesr or ſins that are committed by, or againſt the major part of a Nation. There were <hi>Egypts</hi> ſins for which God judged that Nation. <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſins for which that People periſhed by Sword, Famine, and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity. <hi>Babels</hi> ſins for which that Kingdom was tranſlated. And theſe are this <hi>Nations</hi> ſins which will deſtroy it if the people of it do not vigorouſly ſtir up, and call upon one another to joyn as one man, to redreſs all wrongs, and to ſatisfie all juſt Intereſts.</p>
            <p>They that ſtir up, and provoke the people and their Truſtees to do Juſtice equal and impartial, are looked upon as Diſturbers, and Traytors; but they indeed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>upport the Nation, and to that end, muſt perſevere in the ſame faithful diſcharge of their duties to God, the Nation, and themſelves: if they fail, the Nation falls. Sins political and univerſal are of like nature, for which many Cities were, and the world in a Type was, and ſhall be in the anti-type, deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>If the Nation, or part of it, or the people, whether few or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſhall ſtir up one another to joyn as one man, to purſue the Peace of the Nation, by an Agreement in Righteouſneſs, to free themſelves and it from their Nation ſins. All ſuch ſo joyning ſhall be gethered together unto the Lord, the Rock of their and this Nations deliverance, as all Iſrael was gathered together as one man unto the Lord at Miſpeh.</p>
            <p>All Iſrael that were not gathered together with Iſrael as one man unto the Lord at Miſpeh, to free themſelves and Nation from their Nation ſin (to wit the inhabitants of Jaoeſh Gillead)
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:32682:27"/>were all, men, women, and children (except 400) utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. So all in this Nation that ſhall not ſtir up, and call upon the people, and upon one another to joyn in an Agreement in Righteouſneſs for the paace of the Nation, and to free it and themſelves from their Nation ſins, ſhall therein divide and ſcatter themſelves from the Lord, the rock of their and this Nations de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, and be more guilty of, and lyable to their own utter ruin and deſtruction then the men of Jabeſh Gillead were; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there can be no compare betwixt a Nation ſin, derived from a private family, and a Nation ſin derived from a Nation. It is likewiſe juſt with God and men, That all they of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſit ſtill as the men of Jabeſh Gillead did, or that hinder the Nations deliverance from their and its ſins and deſtruction, that call not upon the people to joyn unto the Lord as one man, in order to theſe ends; or hinder others from calling upon them, of that ſhall harden their hearts that are called upon: That they that will not help forward, but hinder Redreſs of wrongs, and ſatisfaction of juſt Intereſts; that will not help forward, or ſhall hinder the cauſing of a new Repreſentative; and that will not help forward, or that ſhall hinder an Agreement of the Nation in Righteouſneſs, ſhould anſwer and ſatisfie for theſe wrongs and damages that bloud ſhed, and theſe outrages and barbarous cruelties which are cauſed by their oppoſitions and obſtructions in theſe relations.</p>
            <p>All Iſrael fled, and fell twice before <hi>Benjamine,</hi> and <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> ſlew 40000 of them: and the reaſon of it (is conceived) was, Becauſe Iſrael was not ſo circumſpect and diligent to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge all faithfulneſs of duty to one another in exciting and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon one another; and becauſe they did not excite and call upon the men of Jabeſh Gillead to hearken and to joyn with them as one man unto the Lord to free their Nation, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from their Nation ſin.</p>

            <p>The Nation (for want of clear conviction) is made guilty of their blood that ſtand moſt firme for the Peace, and ſafety of it: becauſe the judgements and ſpirits of the People are not convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced who are faithful, and who not: and what blood is ſhed (juſtly) and what unjuſtly, therefore the Nation ſin of blood ſhed is ſet upon it (as the dye of ſcarlet dy'd in wool) neither can it be
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:32682:32"/>freed from it without conviction of the judgments and ſpirits of the People, becauſe it cannot repent of it (for how ſhould the People repent of that blood ſhed and thoſe wrongs, and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for which they conceive they ought rather to rejoyce, or know nothing to the contrary) therefore (that the Nation may be freed from theſe chaines of its ſins, and deſtruction) all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful endeavors (by joynt addreſſe of the Nation) muſt be made to convince the judgements and ſpirits of the people, that they may be convinced and ſatisfied, who are and have bin faithful, and who not: who ſtand or have ſtood firme to their juſt Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the Nations ſafety, and who againſt the peace and ſafety of it: what, and whoſe blood is juſtly ſpilt in order to free the Nation from guilt of blood ſhed, and what blood and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions polute and defile the Nation, and are (earneſtly) to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of. I determine not who are, or have bin faithful and who not, what blood is ſpilt juſtly, and what unjuſtly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of: But had all differences bin peaceably and freely deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by miſſives in writing (as divers well-affected of the Nation and Army did humbly Petition the Parliment) there had bin no ground of the laſt deſperate war, nor danger of a third, and all differences and grounds of war might have bin (by reaſon and ſatisfaction) reconciled and compoſed in peace.</p>
            <p n="8">8ly. The reaſon of the neceſſity, and the manner of chuſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentors are ſhown already, and further are, becauſe they are the fiteſt inſtruments to convince the judgments and ſpirits of the people in theſe things, by which the general ſafety of the Nation may be procured, and wherein ſatisfaction of all juſt intereſts to all perſons doth conſiſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe they are fitteſt to take cognizance and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of every particular and private mans wrongs and grievances, and to procure ful and through redreſſe of them,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, becauſe they are the fitteſt meanes to gather the people into order and unity; and to keep the juſt power of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and ſoveraignty in their hands: <hi>How oft</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>would I have gathered you together as a hen gathereth her chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens under her, and you would not:</hi> nothing tendeth more to cauſe and conſerve the intire ſafety and peace of the Nation, or to conſtitute a firme Agreement of the people, than to gather the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:32682:32"/>people into order, and unity, which cannot be done but by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentors, whom they chuſe by their own power and freedom, and who remain (continually) liable to be queſtioned, depoſed, or continued by the ſame power, and freedom.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, becauſe Repreſentors are the proper intermediate inſtruments betwixt the people, and all ſubjects, ends, and objects of their freedom, peace and ſafety (as the neck inſtrumentally diſpenceth and returneth life and ſence to all parts of the body) by them a new Repreſentative of the Nation may be (eaſily and freely) choſen, which cannot be otherwiſe obtained.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by them the ſoveraignity, power, and freedom of the people may be derived, and convayed to their Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, that they may improve it (in righteouſneſs) for the profit, peace, and ſafety of the Nation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by them the increaſe and benefit of the peoples ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty, power, and freedom, may be returned back from their Repreſentatives to the people, otherwiſe it is, and wil be (wholy) obſtructed.</p>
            <p n="9">9ly. The reaſons of an Agreement are, becauſe if an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be not, the diſſolution of the whole Nation muſt follow: When the <hi>clay</hi> and <hi>Iron in the feet of the great image,</hi> could not agree and mix, the whole body of the <hi>Image was daſht in peices,</hi> and diſſolved; It is every mans dutie to diſcharge his utmoſt faith and care, to continue all juſt wayes, and meanes to procure the peace, and Agreement of the people, and Nations ſafety: And that only (which can cauſe and continue a firme Agreement) is juſt ſatisfaction of all Intereſts, (without which no right Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be made, or kept, and the nations deſtruction muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, Therefore let the nation rouſe up it ſelf, and let the people of it ſtir up one another, to joyn as one man unto the Lord <hi>(as Iſrael did unto the Lord at Mizpah)</hi> and agree that all juſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts may be ſatisfied; that the poor and middle ſort of people may have their juſt intereſts, the rich theirs, the Nation its, the Soldiers theirs, the disbanded, ſick, and wounded Soldiers, and Officers theirs, and that Widdows, Orphans, and friends of thoſe (that are dead and ſlain) their intereſts, that all evil doers may have their due intereſts, and they that do well theirs. That Presbyterians and Independents may have their proper intereſts,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:32682:33"/>the late Kings party theirs, Papiſts and Proteſtants theirs, the conſcientious party theirs, and that all ſects, nations, and perſons, may have their juſt rights. Let the Nation and Army (at leaſt they that are conſcientious in both) cal upon, and ſtir up the people and one another (to vindicate and diſ-oblige their faith in truth and righteouſneſs) <hi>unlooſe the bands of wickedneſſe, undo the heavy burthens, break every yoak and let the oppreſſed go free.</hi> Let them feed the hungry, harbour the poor, and cloth the naked at leaſt in their own houſes, and with their own food and ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. To ſay the ſatisfying of all juſt intereſts would undo, or impoveriſh the Nation is abſurd, and wicked: for the not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of all juſt intereſts is the utter undoing, and deſtruction of the Nation: and that real crying ſin, and guilt of blood (filling the hands of all perſons and overflowing (as a boundleſs River) the whole Land) whereof the rivers of <hi>Aegypt (turn'd into blood)</hi> were but types and ſhaddows; But grant that the ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all juſt intereſts would undo and impoveriſh the Nation, yet to do it were but juſtice, and what God abſolutely willeth and requireth: and the not doing of it is in every perſon (under what ſpecious pretence of holineſs ſoever) a rejecting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of God, and a rebeling againſt him; And to ſuppoſe or ſay it would impoveriſh, and undo the Nation, is moſt abſurd, and falſe, for ſuppoſe (a man having many bones broken and ſhivers cauſing violent feavers, and ſymptomes of death) a Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon ſhould ſet right all his bones aſſwage his feaver, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the party to perfect health of body, limbe, and life, it were moſt ſenſeleſs for that party to ſay he were impoveriſht, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, becauſe all his joynts and bones are ſet right, and he fully reſtored to perfect health: Iuſt intereſts (unſatisfied) are fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures and diſtortions in the body Politique (the nation) and ſhivers cauſing feavers and death; and every man in the Nation is a diſtorted member, a limbe out of joynt, a broken bone, or ſhiver; becauſe every man is deprived of his, or depriveth others of their proper rights, and intereſts: Now ſuppoſe every diſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and broken limbe, ſhiver, and bone, were ſet right in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per compage, and place (that is) if every ſeveral perſon of the Nation did (reciprocally) give, afford to, and receive from each other their reſpective rights, and juſt intereſts: it were moſt
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:32682:33"/>unreaſonable and abſurd, that the Nation, or any of it ſhould ſay, that all its bones and limbes are broken, and out of joynt; but now all are ſet right and healed, therefore the Nation is impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhed, and undon, that every perſon (in the body Politique) was deprived of his, or did deprive others of their proper intereſt, but now every man injoys his own juſt due, and proper right, therefore the Nation is impoveriſhed, and undon. That the not ſatisfying of all juſt intereſts cauſed violent feavers and evils of war and famin, and deſperate ſymptomes of deſtruction to the Nation: But now the Nation (by ſatisfying all juſt intereſts) hath happily recovered perfect health and peace in truth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Nation is impoveriſhed and undon; all ſuch concluſions are moſt falſe and wicked, and the contrary concluſions are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly true; therefore they that ſhal bring the guilt of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſins, and their, and its deſtruction upon it, and upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are and muſt be without all colour or excuſe.</p>
            <p n="10">10 But laſtly, (if the people like <hi>Jabeſh Gilead</hi>) ſhall ſit under the ſhadow of their own deſtruction, in chains of bondage and death, and ſhall not as one man unite to purſue and Agreement in Righteouſneſs, or if no ſuch Agreement ſhall or can be procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; Then all the Free-born of the Nation, are with all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſpeedy care and providence, to conſtitute ſuch a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment amongſt themſelves, as may by Juſtice abſolute and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, preſerve the Perſons, Eſtates, Lives, and entire Beings of each other, and of all thoſe that cloſe with, and adhere unto them; and to come (at the call and command of God) forth from Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel (falling down as a Milſtone caſt by the hand of a mighty Angel into the midſt of the Sea.</p>
            <p>The reaſons are, becauſe there is a neceſſity laid upon them from the call and command of God, and alſo God gives the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of this neceſſity, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4. <hi>Come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her ſins, and that ye receive not of her plagues:</hi> Her (that is Babylon) is the great City, called ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Sodom, Aegypt, Babylon, where alſo our Lord was crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: this, and all Nations, the whole World: Her ſins, and plagues, are the ſins of thoſe Cities, and the plagues of their ſins in the Truth and ſubſtance, which were in theſe Cities in a type. Gods call and command for his people to come out of her, is
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:32682:34"/>the ſubſtance of his call to <hi>Lot</hi> in Sodom by <hi>Angels,</hi> to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in Aegypt by <hi>Moſes,</hi> to the <hi>Iews</hi> in Babylon by <hi>Prophets,</hi> and to the <hi>Saints</hi> in Jury by <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My people, that is, all that are (ſo far as man may judge) o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to the call and command of God, to be delivered from her ſins and plagues, and their own deſtruction, as <hi>Lots</hi> Family in Sodom, and <hi>Noahs</hi> Family in the Ark, were obedient to the call and command of God in a Type; <hi>Lots</hi> Family in Sodom was (in a Type) obedient to the call and command of God, to be delivered from her ſins, and deſtruction; and all creatures, clean, and unclean, birds, beaſts, and creeping things that came into the Ark, were (in a figure) obedient to the call and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God to be delivered from the deſtruction upon the world by the flood: So all perſons, and creatures, clean and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, that manifeſt obedience to the call and command of God (by coming out of Babel) that they may be delivered from her ſins, plagues, and deſtruction, are here meant by the people of God. Secondly, All that have deſires, and ſpirits of Freedom, from being real bond-ſlaves to all oppreſſions and miſeries, and ſin, and death, of body and ſpirit (as Iſrael groaned to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their ſore oppreſſions, and miſeries, and ſlaviſh deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) are here meant by the people of God.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, God calls and commands his people in Babylon, to come out of her; and the anſwer of their obedience to him, and the onely means of their deliverance from her ſins and plagues, is (according to their call and command from God) to come out of her. Iſraels going out, was local and corporal; this real, and ſpiritual: not by change of place, but of the order, form, and end of their Government.</p>
            <p>All Nations are Babylon, but this Nation is the Tower of it: All are the Cities of the Plain, but this Sodom, where <hi>Lot</hi> dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and preſerveth them and it from deſtruction. All Nations are the body of the beaſt, the ſerpent, but its head (where its eys, life, and wiles are, is in this Nation. God hath promiſed the ſeed of the woman ſhall break the ſerpents head; not in type, but in truth; not by promiſe, or paſſing that ſentence of judgement, but by performance and execution of it: The breach upon its head, begins here, and in this Nation the firſt ſtroke is
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:32682:34"/>given for Babels downfal: Therefore there is a ſtrict neceſſity (from God upon all his people) to obey him, and come out of her, leſt they, in the body of this dying ſerpent, utterly periſh with it: The onely ſafeſt way, and beſt means for the people of God to come out of her (in order to their own perfect Freedom and Peace) is to diſcharge all faithfulneſs to her, to move her, if it may be, to an Agreement in Righteouſneſs, to inform and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince her of, and in all wiſdom and meekneſs, to reprove her for her ſins, the cauſe of her plagues and deſtruction. When <hi>Moſes</hi> continued to diſcharge all faithfulneſs to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, then their deſtruction came, and Iſraels deliverance. When <hi>Lot</hi> ceaſed not to admoniſh Sodom, two Angels came and freed him, and fire fell and deſtroy'd it. And the people of God in Babylon, exerciſing all goodneſs (what may be with Juſtice) towards her, diſcharging all faithfulneſs to her, advertiſing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, and exhorting her to forſake her ſins, the cauſe of her plagues; and ſhe not hearkning, doth more fully and cleerly ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie their going out of her; and magnifie the righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, in pouring forth upon her, the full vials of her plagues and deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The reaſon of this neceſſity upon the people of God, that they muſt come out of her, is, becauſe of the greatneſs of her ſins. The violence and cruelties of the old World, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom's ſins, Aegypts iniquities and murders, Babels pride, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, preſumption, and Jeruſalems phariſaical bloudy hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, were but types of her ſins: Her ſins, preſumption, pride, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, guilt of innocent bloud, inſolent and wicked confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and hardneſs of heart, tranſcends theirs, as truth exceeds the Type, and as a real ſubſtance the ſhadow; and they that come not out of her, commit theſe her ſins, and muſt ſuffer her plagues.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They muſt come out of her, becauſe of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the voice of Gods call, and ſtrictneſs of his command. His cals to the old World, Sodom, Babylon, and Jeruſalem, were but Types: And the voice of Gods miracles by <hi>Moſes,</hi> the voice, of that expreſs type of the Harp of God, <hi>Moſes</hi> wiſdom and meekneſs, and the ſilver ſhrill Trumpet of <hi>Aarons</hi> Eloquence, which ſummoned <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to hearken, and free Iſrael from their
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:32682:35"/>bonds of ſlavery and death, wherein they were deſtroyed and murdered, and which ſummoned Iſrael to hearken, and to free themſelves (if <hi>Pharoah</hi> did not) from thoſe bonds, were but types of Gods call to Babylon: But God diſpenſeth his ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to her, to hearken, and to his people in her, to come out of her (if ſhe hearken not) under the figure of a mighty Angel, crying with a loud voice, as when a Lyon roareth, and under the ſimilitude of ſeven thunders, uttering their voices, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.3. Therefore her ſins and hardneſs of heart are, and her plagues muſt be ſo much greater (if ſhe hearken not) by how much greater her ſummons, and the call of God is: and the rebellions and diſobedience of the people of God in her are; and their plagues, if they come not out of her, muſt be ſo much greater, by how much their ſummons, and Gods call to them to come out of her is greater.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The people of God muſt come out of her, becauſe if they be in her when ſhe falls (as a Milſtone caſt into the Sea by a mighty Angel) they muſt (after all her fore-running plagues are inflicted upon them) fall with her into the deepeſt and moſt irrecoverable deſtruction; and becauſe they in her (at her beſt, much more in her dying condition, are as <hi>Ionas</hi> was in (her fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure) the Whales belly, where his complaint was, <hi>That the weeds wrapt about his head in the Belly of hell, That the depth in the midſt of the Sea encloſed him, That he went down to the bottom of the Mountains, That the Earth with her Bars were about him for ever.</hi> So the people of God in the belly of this Leviathan are caged, and impriſoned in bondage to her ſins, death and miſeries involve and incloſe them, and the weeds of her wickedneſs and deſtruction wrap about them, and if they get not out of her before ſhe fall, and ſink as a Milſtone, they periſh for ever.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, The people of God in Babylon are to come out of her, becauſe ſhe is already fallen or falling in her quickning form, her Righteouſneſs; after which her plagues and her total fall muſt follow, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.2. <hi>An Angel cryed mightily with a ſtrong voice, ſaying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen;</hi> that is, is fallen ſick irrecoverably in the form of her being, her righteouſneſs; and is become the habitation of Devils, &amp;c. and then, and not before,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:32682:35"/>a voice from heaven called and commanded the people of God in her, to come out of her; for if ſhe do not, or ſhall not fall from righteouſneſs, which onely can ſupport her from falling, and the people of God in her from periſhing, if ſhe retain Truth, that the people of God may retain peace in Truth, I mean not aëry tenents of truth, but practique and executive truth, which is righteouſneſs; then the people of God in her, are in no wiſe to come out of her, but they are to pray for the peace of Babylon, and to ſeek it, for in her peace they ſhall have peace. Neither were the people of God ever called or commanded to come out of her, until ſhe be firſt fallen, or falling in her righteouſneſs (her and their form, and life of their being: but if no addreſs or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in righteouſneſs, whereby all juſt intereſts may be ſatisfied, ſhall be endeavoured, or ſhall or can be made; and if Babylon be already fallen, or falling in her ſupporting form, her righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; if ſhe be an habitation of Devils, a ſtrong hold wherein every foul ſpirit is fortified: Then God with a ſtrong voice calls and commands his people to come out of her, and then her plagues are coming upon her, and her final deſtruction follows: But it is to be feared that ſhe is already fallen in her ſupporting form, and become a ſtrong hold wherein every foul ſpirit is forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and that the plagues of her deſtruction have ſeized, or are ſeizing upon her, becauſe ſhe vomits up all antidotes which ſhould expel her ſins, the poiſon of her plagues: If a man (infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the plague, be taken with a violent vomiting and caſting, it ſhews that the plague hath ſeized, or is ſeizing upon the life. When God ſent all his plagues upon <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart, and upon the hearts of his ſervants they vomited up the antidotes of wholeſom admonitions by <hi>Moſes;</hi> which ſhewed that thoſe plagues had ſeized upon the life of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his ſervants, and were the plagues of their deſtruction: So Babylon is taken with a violent vomiting and caſting: If any wholeſom means or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine of faithful and ſincere admonitions be given her, ſhe vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits it up; If any thing profitable for her peace and ſafety be propoſed to her, or if any thing that ſhould free her from her ſins, break her ſickneſs, and bring health, be given her, her ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack nauſeates and loaths it, it ſtaies not there, ſhe caſts it up again; her ſoul loaths all cordial antidotes againſt the poyſon of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:32682:36"/>her plagues; which ſhews that ſhe is fallen or falling in her ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting form, her righteouſneſs, and become a ſtrong hold wherein every foul ſpirit is fortified, and that the plagues of her deſtruction have ſeized, or are ſeizing upon her.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, The people of God muſt come out of her, becauſe they al ſo are fallen from their righteouſneſs, which is their and her ſole life and ſupport, and therefore cannot ſupport her, nor be ſupported in her: They were once in (her type) that great Image in <hi>Daniel,</hi> a head of gold compact, and knit in Righteouſneſs, and had (in, and with her) a Kingdom, Power, Strength, and Glory: Then they were in that Image (as a little gold) in its Breaſt and Arms of Silver, which did not change the name and property of Silver, yet did ſupport the whole Body, that it fell not: Then they were as a little gold in its Belly, and Thighs of Braſs, which did not change the property of Braſs, yet did ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the whole Body that it fell not: Then they were as a little gold in its legs of Iron, not changing the property of Iron, yet did they ſupport thoſe legs of Iron, and the whole Body, that it fell not: Then they were as a little gold in its feet and toes, that were part Iron, and part clay, not changing the property of Iron and Clay, yet did they ſupport thoſe Feet and Toes, of Iron and Clay, and the whole Body, that it fell not: But now the Iron will not mix with the Gold, but rejects it, and thinks to rule by perfect force of the Sword alone, and will have no power of the gold (by Law and Righteouſneſs) mixt in its government, and gold, mixing with myrie clay, is made weaker, and more emba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: Therefore the gold in this Image, that is, the people of God in Babylon, can now no more ſupport her, or themſelves in her, from falling.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, But the people of God in Babylon are ſo far from ſupporting her, or themſelves, that they are (if they come not out of her) the firſt that muſt fall and be deſtroyed: The two middle pillars in <hi>Dagons</hi> houſe (upon which the houſe ſtood, and on which it was born up) fell firſt, and then all the Houſe fell: So the people of God in Babylon, are the middle pillars upon which ſhe ſtands, and on which ſhe is born up, and ſhall be (if they come not out of her) the firſt that muſt fall and be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:32682:36"/> 8ly. The people of God in <hi>Babylon</hi> muſt come out of her, becauſe ſhe rejecteth God and them, <hi>Saul</hi> rejected God and <hi>Samuel,</hi> and God him, and <hi>Samuel</hi> came no more at him (but prayed for him) unto the day of his death. When <hi>Pharoah</hi> and his ſervants rejected the juſt Addreſſes of the Elders of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and the crys of the <hi>Iſraelits,</hi> and drove out <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> from their preſence, then their deſtruction and <hi>Iſraels</hi> deliverance from bondage was at hand, ſo Babylon rejecteth all cals and commands of God, rejecteth the crys of the poor, and periſhing free-born peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, rejecteth all juſt Addreſſes, and drives out the people of God from her preſence in Army and Nation, therefore (it may be feard, the plagues of her deſtruction are coming upon her, and therefore the people of God in her may juſtly, and muſt come out of her.</p>
            <p n="9">9ly. They muſt come out of her: becauſe (as the people of God in Babylon did (by their righteouſneſs) ever ſuport her and themſelves in her) ſo if they come not out of her (being called and commanded of God) their ſins of ſtubborneſs and rebellion againſt God ſhal be the only main cauſe of bringing the plagues of her deſtruction, and her ſal upon her and upon themſelves, as <hi>Ionas</hi> (by his ſin of diſobedience) was the only cauſe that the ſhip and all in it was ready to ſink and periſh, until they caſt him out into the Sea: So the people of God in Babylon who by their righteouſneſs have ever heretofore ſuported her and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from falling, ſhal now (being called (if they come not out of her) ſink her, and deſtroy her and themſelves, (by their ſinnes of ſtuborneſs and rebelion againſt God; and it is not likely that they ſhould preſerve and ſupport her or themſelves in her any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="10">10ly. The people of God cannot ſupport her nor ſubſiſt in her, and therefore muſt come out of her, becauſe her Governors and Commanders are bruitiſhly violent, and impatient, and (by impatience incapable of being convinced by reaſon, and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, <hi>Nabal</hi> (as a foole) railed upon <hi>Davids</hi> meſſengers that came in peace and ſent them away empty with a churliſh anſwer; And <hi>Pharoah</hi> ſaid to <hi>Moſes, get thee from me, ſee my face no more, for in that day thou ſeeſt my face thou ſhalt die.</hi> But
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:32682:37"/>theſe (as <hi>Nabals</hi> ſervants ſaid of him) are ſuch ſonnes of <hi>Belial</hi> that the people of God cannot ſpeak to them, nor make any humble and faithful Addreſſes to them, to undeceive and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince their judgements, and cauſe them to ſee and forſake their bloody ſins and oppreſſions, or (if they do make any ſuch hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and faithful Addreſſes) they do not only raile upon them (as <hi>Nabal</hi> did) and ſend them away emptie with churliſh an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers: but add greater wrongs to their injuries, and cruelty to their oppreſſions; they anſwer their humble and faithful Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes by doing double injurie, and ſatisfie their juſt intereſts by making their oppreſſions ſo much greater, as their thigh is thicker than their little finger, they do not only threaten to kill them (as <hi>Pharoah</hi> did <hi>Moſes</hi>) but do murder and kill them, either by immediate ſtroak of lawleſs and wicked violence, or by injury, oppreſſion, and extortion: But they will not believe that injuries, oppreſſions, and extortions, (wel hooded and masked under falſe formes of holy pretences) can be murder: as if <hi>Saul</hi> (ſtanding in the midſt of the people) was <hi>Saul:</hi> but <hi>Saul</hi> (hid amongſt the ſtuffe was not <hi>Saul</hi>) but <hi>Saul</hi> hid amongſt the ſtuffe was <hi>Saul, and the people ran and brought him thence, and he ſtood before the people;</hi> So injuries, oppreſſions, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortions, (hooded and masked under formes of holy pretences) are murders hid in the ſtuffe, and the people muſt run (as the <hi>Iſraelits</hi> did) to fetch them thence, and ſet them before the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Murders of the talleſt ſtatures are ever hid amongſt the ſtuffe; and theſe implicit maſſacres are moſt in number, and the worſt kinds of murder, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.9. <hi>They that be ſlain with the ſword are better than they that are ſlain with hunger.</hi> Therefore to murder the poor, or midle-ſort of people, or the Soldiers by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty or hunger, cauſed by unjuſt oppreſſion, is worſe than to ſlay them with the ſword: If the people do not ſeek out theſe ſiniſter and implicit murders that are hiden amongſt the ſtuffe and ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="11">11ly. They cannot ſupport her becauſe of the grand impoſturies of her Sorcerers, and Seducers, who (by her harkning to them) do deceive and harden her heart. The Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> and their ſervants did once harken to the wholſome councel of the people
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:32682:37"/>of God (then they exceeded all Nations in peace riches, ſtrength and glory) but when they rejected their counſel and harkened to Sorcerers, and corrupters (creatures moſt vile and filthy) they were led and fel into infamous ſins, and the plagues of their deſtruction came upon them: But by her (that is <hi>Babels</hi> Sorcerers) all Nations are deceived, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18 23.

            <p n="12">12ly. The people of God in <hi>Babylon</hi> cannot ſupport her from falling, becauſe they themſelves are fallen in the ſpirit of their forme, which is love. The Apoſtle diſtiguiſheth man into body, ſoul, and ſpirit, and the form of the new man into faith, hope, and love; Spirits are the fiery, living and executive powers of creatures ſo is love in the people of God: But their love is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from all lively executive heat and become (contrary to the nature of ſpirits) cold: The <hi>love</hi> of many ſaith our Saviour <hi>ſhal wax cold;</hi> Coldneſs of love is the power of death in the ſpirit, and ſourſe of life, from whence univerſal defection in the people of God floweth, their goodneſs, righteouſneſs, and faith is cold, dying and decaying, their courage and conſtancy waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as a wave of the Sea, the Sun, and the light, and the Moon, and the Starres are in them darkened; Their faith to God and man doth but deceive and deſtroy themſelves and others, they are pillars made up of ſhadows and deceits, daſhing pitchers, broken pot-ſheards. <hi>The ſtars of heaven fell to the earth as a fig-tree caſts her untimely figs, when ſhe is ſhaken of a mighty wind.</hi> Rev. 6.13.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:32682:38"/>They are the ſtars fallen from heaven to earth, from heat to cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; from life to death, or are dying; They are Fig-trees that keep their leaves; and caſt their fruits; They have left the power of Righteouſneſs, for appearances, and embraced (like <hi>Demas</hi>) this preſent World; Their Deſignes and Actions relate not to God, nor the good of one another, but terminate in their own corrupt ends and intereſts: They are ignorant of true Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and know not what it is, nor wherein it conſiſts, but are zealous in their own Righteouſneſs: For the Jews (the Type of the people of God) had a Righteouſneſs of their own, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were exceeding ſtrict, and that Righteouſneſs was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme wickedneſs: So the people of God have a Righteouſneſs not of God, but of their own; not of faith, but of their own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; and they are zealous in tihs their own Righteouſneſs: The Righteouſneſs which the Jews had of their own, conſiſted in Sacrifices, refrainings from meats, waſhings, and in ſolemn fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Aſſemblies and Meetings, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.10. and they were moſt hot and violent in purſuit of this their own Righteouſneſs (when they were moſt cold, and fallen in their love to true Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: So the people of God being moſt cold, and fallen in their love to true Righteouſneſs, are moſt hot and violent in purſuit of their own Righteouſneſs, which conſiſts much in many Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings, and fruitleſs ſolemn Meetings, moſt needful were they well improved where they come together to ſerve God, by jaring one with another.

The oppreſſors of Gods people deny them ſtraw, afflict them with burdens and hard bondage, and all their ſervice (wherein they make them to ſerve) is with rigour: <hi>Iſraels</hi> oppreſſors kept back Straw; but theſe both ſtraw and corn; they kept back fuel, theſe food and raiment: they kept back that ſtraw which was the Egyptians; but theſe keep back that Straw (that food and raiment) which belongs to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and (if they would eat ſtraw, or if ſtraw would ſave their lives, they will not allow them their own ſtraw (with ſuch violent rigour do they make them ſerve in ſlavery) therefore were the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſcattered over all Egypt to gather ſtubble inſtead of ſtraw, that the fires of their Briekilnes might not dy.

            <p>Many alſo are cauſed to treſpaſſe and blaſpheme through the rigour and cruelty of oppreſſion, (therefore their oppreſſors are guilty of oppreſſion and blaſphemy,) and the Authors of it: their paſſions indeed (thereby provoked) have been the bellows of theſe diſtempers: and the right temper of the beſt mettal may be ſpoyled in an over-heated forge, yet not the mettal nor the forge, nor the bellows, but the black Smith is the author of theſe diſtempers, but the effects of their provocations (in the yron furnaces of their oppreſſions and ſlavery) are not light diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers: but all compoſed order, wiſdom, and ſobriety, and their ſpiritual endowments, and righteouſneſſe, which ſhould ſupport them are reduced (through the vehemency of the fire, and rage of their ſlaverie) not into ſindars, but aſhes; like the aſhes of the fornace which <hi>Moſes</hi> took, and ſprinkled up towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which became ſmall duſt ſcattered throughout the land of Egypt: and Heaven ſaw that ſcattered duſt, and turn'd it into a real Plague upon all the Land of Egypt. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> was moſt falne to duſt and aſhes, God then raiſed them; when they were moſt ſlain he then revived them; when moſt ſcattered, he then gathered them; and when they were moſt irrecoverable, and deſparately loſt, he then ſought them out, and that there might be no appearance of mans power, in their deliverance; he then ſaved them from bondage, and deſtruction of body and ſpirit: So his people being moſt fallen, ſlain, ſcattered, and loſt, God will now raiſe and gather them out of duſt, and arm and unite them in life and power, that there may be nothing of theirs, nor of man, but of God only in their deliverance; and that his power alone may be made known: by calling <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of Egypt, and cauſing them to hearken was <hi>Iſrael</hi> delivered, and by calling his People out of Egypt and Babylon, the houſe of their bondage and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and cauſing them to hearken, ſhall his people be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered.</p>

            <p> Laſtly, The ſecond principal cauſe and end of their coming out of her is, that they might with all ſpeedy care and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, make and conſtitute ſuch a Government amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as may by Juſtice abſolute and impartial, preſerve the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, eſtates, lives, and entire beings of each other, and of all thoſe that cloſe with, and co-adhere unto them: Such Government conſiſts in a right conſtitution and Direction: In a right conſtituted Government the power is to be (for ſubſtance) wholy in the people, and not in pretenſe or title, but really. This power is the power of God, the richeſt Talent of his goodneſs which he diſpenſeth to a people; If they improve it well, it brings the greateſt Safety, Peace, Freedom, and Proſperity, that a People can have, and if they improve it ill, the greateſt confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ruine, and deſtruction. Therefore the people are ſeriouſly and adviſedly to conſider how they may beſt improve it to Gods glory, and their benefit: They are to conſider it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to God, in relation to it ſelf, and in relation to themſelves. This power in relation to God, is the power of God, demiſed and diſpenſed from him to a people for their Proſperity, Peace, and Safety. Secondly, In it ſelf it is the richeſt Talent which a people can receive from God, therefore God will require the ſtricteſt account of them for their improvement of it. That ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant that loſt not, nor waſted his maſters Talent, but kept it, and return'd it back to his maſter, was called <hi>a wicked ſlothful, and an unprofitable ſervant, and caſt into utter darkneſs,</hi> becauſe he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>d not increaſe and improve it. All powers are of God, therefore all Powers are good; but ſome Powers are (in relations) evil, wicked, and unjuſt; the evil and injuſtice in Powers, is the abuſe of them: That people or perſons that corrupt and abuſe the Powers of God, or that obey thoſe Powers (as corrupted and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed) rebel againſt the Power of God, and do not keep, but loſe and abuſe the richeſt Talent of his goodneſs. Laſtly, Juſt Powers (in relation to the People) are the breath of their life from God, and the Form and Eſſence of their Beings, without which the people are (as they ever have bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, That the People may improve their Talent of juſt power with all faithfulneſs to God (whoſe it is) and to themſelves (to whom) for their joynt preſervation from bondage and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction it is commited, they muſt conſider that the people are many ſeveral, or ſingle, and there can be no joynt improvement by many ſingle or ſeveral. A ſingle file or hair of ſilk hath no ſtrength, and millions of files, or hairs of ſilk (ſingle or ſeveral) have no more ſtrength than one ſingle file. If they let (their Talent) this power reſt in every mans hand (ſingle) they bury it in the earth, and improve it not, but bring infinite deſtruction upon themſelves; for where many are together ſingle and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twiſted, there muſt needs be great diſ-union and diviſion, from whence utter confuſion and deſtruction to all (ſeverally) muſt follow: Therefore the peoples chief and ſpeedy care muſt be, to find out the fitteſt and beſt means and expedients to unite and twiſt them in this power. The means and expedients that are beſt and fiteſt to unite and twiſt them in this power of God, are Repreſentors and Repreſentatives freely choſen by them in ſuch manner as I have already ſet down, to which I refer the Reader. Faithful and juſt Repreſentors (freely choſen) are like the ſtalks in bunches of grapes, that feed, nouriſh, and unite all the berries, and they derive pure wine, life, and power to the people, from the root and ſtem of the true Vine. The people muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as God hath committed (the richeſt Talent of his goodneſs) their juſt power into their own hands, that they do not ſet light by, ſlight, or profane it, that they be not ſlothful, wicked, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful in improving of it, nor chuſe ſuch as are ſlothful, wicked, and unfaithful to be Repreſentors or Repreſentatives, leſt they loſe or abuſe the Talent which God hath given them, and God ſtrictly require it at their hands, and leſt they miſ-improve it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the people, and deſtroy the people and themſelves by it: to avoid which, let them chuſe men moſt endowed with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit (not of bondage, but) of Freedom, juſt, faithful, fearing God, dealing truly, and hating Covetouſneſs; They are to chuſe the

So it is better for people to chuſe the poor of this world rich in faith to God and them, then the rich of this World, poor in faith, to God and them, to be their Truſtees, Repreſentors. God offered the Goſpel to the <hi>Iewes, and ſuch as were ſaved, gladly received it:</hi> but God caſt off thoſe that rejected it, and the Apoſtles and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God departed from them, and turned to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſo an Agreement and Government (in righteouſneſs) muſt be ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, and faithfully offered to the whole Nation, that the whole Nation may be joyned as one man unto the Lord, in an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in righteouſneſs, <hi>as all Iſrael was gathered together unto the Lord at Mizpah,</hi> ſuch as ſhall reſiſt, or refuſe ſuch Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Government, or ſhall harden their hearts (as <hi>Pharoah</hi> and his ſervants) or ſhall ſit ſtill as the men of <hi>Iabiſh Gilead</hi> did, or that ſhall reject ſuch a government and Agreement (as the <hi>Iewes</hi> rejected the Goſpel) are to be left to themſelves, and the people of God (that they may be freed from <hi>Babels</hi> ſins, and plagues, and from her fall, and deſtruction) muſt come out from

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:32682:45"/>and they by ready hearkening and obedience willingly received it; Did they then return to the valley of bones? never, but became an exceeding great Army, and never ſould themſelves into bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage unto death, and deſtruction any more. <hi>Iſrael</hi> (being ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of bondage wherein they were ſcattered in <hi>Egypt</hi>) was an exceeding great Army; before the moſt miſerable and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh: but then the freeſt-people that ever were; They that were poor amongſt them before, were then rich, and the perſons and eſtates of poor and rich were-freed from bondage, all the houſe of bondage durſt not lay their hand upon a Kid of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to bring it back into bondage; Before there was no appearance of the life and power of God in them; The drie bones (when God called upon them to hearken and live, did hearken and live, but <hi>Iſrael</hi> at firſt, when God called upon them to hearken, and live) did not hearken: but refuſed life <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.9. The life and power of God in his People is firſt manifeſted, by their real hearkening, and reſolved obedience (when God calls them out of bondage) to all that he commandeth, and when their hearkening, obedience, and righteouſneſs are not Sorceries, that is, are not ſayings, but doings, not ſhaddows, but ſubſtance, and not parcels of obedience (which are but Hypocriſie) but perfect obedience. The firſt real appearance of the life, and power of God in <hi>Iſrael</hi> in a Type was, when firſt they (being called out of bondage) did all joyntly hearken unto, and do all that God commanded them (which was when the Paſſeover was firſt kept by them) wherein (as <hi>Moſes was faithful in all the houſe of God</hi> in a Type, ſo were they every man faithful in his own houſe) in all that God commanded; This their joynt faithfulneſs in keeping the Paſſeover in a Type, was the preſent and immediate inſertion, and the ingraffing of them into the life, and power of God, and (that very night) they re-united, and rallied into a living Army, and were delivered from bondage and deſtruction of body and ſpirit in a Type; the Lambe (which they were commanded to kill and eat) was called <hi>the Lords Paſſeover, Exod.</hi> 12.11. and their obſervance of that command was called <hi>the Sacrifice of the Lords Paſſeover; verſ.</hi> 27. It was the firſt Ordinance which God gave unto <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the firſt fruits of their faith and obedience; That Ordinance was an Propheticall

            <p>Thirdly, they might not eat it ſoden in water at all, but roſted with fire, to ſhew, that the ſpirit of Freedom in Gods People muſt and ſhall be fervent as fire, and that their love of deliverance from bondage and ſlavery ſhall not be (as it is) cold, decayed and dead (as Water is the coldeſt of all Elements) God would not accept of but rejected their ſervice that bowed down to drink Water when they were to purſue their deliverance from ſlavery, <hi>Iudges</hi> 7. They that thirſt more after ditch water than Freedom from bondage are ſit for nothing but ſlavery.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, they were to eat it with their ſhooes on their feet, and their ſtaf in their hand, &amp;c. and they were to eat it in haſt, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:32682:46"/>the reaſon is given, <hi>for it is the Lords Paſſeover, verſe</hi> 11. to ſhew, that Gods people muſt and ſhall purſue their deliverance from bondage, with a ready and dilligent preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to depart, and not remiſſely, but in haſt, the reaſon is, <hi>for it is the Lords Paſſeover,</hi> that is, becauſe if they do not haſte to make diligent preparation to come out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> (to which God calls them, and which God commands) and out of all bondage, and if God (when he comes to paſſe through <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi>) find them there, he will lay upon them their, and their own ſins and rebelion, and their and their own due plagues and deſtruction: But his People are not ready for deliverance if God ſhould deliver them, they can no way uſe it but miſ-improve it, to deſtroy themſelves, becauſe they make not any reall and faithful preparation to receive and uſe it, they are all unready, and neither ſhod nor clothed, they have put on no garment, no ſhooes of preparation.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, they were to eat it with their loins girded, and they were not to eat it raw; to ſhew that Gods People muſt and ſhall purſue their deliverance from bondage and deſtruction, not with head-long raſhneſs, but with vigourous adviſedneſs, and not ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teredly; but ſuccinctly and orderly. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> was commanded to obſerve the Paſſeover, they did not confuſedly run to conteſt with their Task-maſters, or to tell the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> of their cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or to continue long, fruitleſs and wicked brawles in word, or writing, nor to demoliſh <hi>Phythom</hi> and <hi>Raamaſes</hi> (Cities of treaſure which they had built for <hi>Pharoah.</hi> Gods People have built all <hi>Babels</hi> Cities of ſtrength, and procured for her all her, power and riches: as they built her Cities, ſo let them fal of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they are called out of her, neither doeth her ſtrength con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in Cities, or Armies: but in the People of God and their righteouſneſs. Why did not <hi>Pharoah</hi> put all the firſt-born of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and his own in <hi>Phythom,</hi> to preſerve them from being deſtroyed? Why did not he and his mighty Hoaſt flee into <hi>Raamſes</hi> to preſerve himſelf and them from being wholely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, without ever ſeeing any one enemie, whilſt they in vain purſued <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to deſtroy them? <hi>Iſrael</hi> had other buſineſs, and being commanded to obſerve the Paſſeover, did with their loines girt obſerve it; So Gods People commanded to obſerve the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:32682:47"/>Paſſeover, ſhall ſpeedily and faithfully prepare it, and with their loines, girt obſerve it; that is, their reſolutions and endeavours to depart from bondage, ſhall and muſt be girt with the girdle of faithfulneſs, righteouſneſs, wiſdom and ſobriety.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Their outward Typical obedience (required and done) was in the ſtriking of the Lintel, and Poſts of the door with the blood of the Lamb, that it might be a token upon the houſes where they were, that God (ſeeing the blood) might paſſe over them, and that the plague might not be upon them to deſtroy them, when he ſhould ſmite the Land, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. A token is a ſigne, or ſeale; This ſigne, or ſeale was in blood, and the life and power of all living creatures is in the blood; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that ſeal was a typical ſeal of the life and power of God in his people. The Anti-type and ſubſtance of that Typical ſeale is, the ſeale of God upon the foreheads of his People, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.3. Theſe are numbred 144000. <hi>ver.</hi> 4. But whether Perſons, or Families the letter doth not clearly determine; <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ſealed by their Families, <hi>Iſraels</hi> Families were Natural and Typical, and theſe Anti-typical (if Families) may be myſtical (freely gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Repreſentors in the life and power of God, they were <hi>Iſrael</hi> theſe are <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they were twelve tribes, theſe are twelve Tribes, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4.5. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> were not ſlain till they were ſealed, <hi>the earth muſt not be hurt till theſe be ſealed.</hi> verſ. 3. God paſt over them, and did not deſtroy them when he ſmote the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and theſe are exempted and redeemed from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the earth <hi>v.</hi> 14.3. They were the Typical Free-born, theſe the true Free-born; They were redeemed from <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage and deſtruction, theſe from the ſlavery, ſins, plagues, and deſtruction of <hi>Sodom, Egypt Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> they Typically, theſe Really and truly; They ſung a Song of deliverance <hi>(Moſes Song)</hi> theſe <hi>ſung a New Song</hi> of deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, <hi>the Song of Moſes and of the Lambe; Exod.</hi> 15. <hi>Revel.</hi> 15.14. That ſeale was an outward Typical ſeale of the life and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God in his People; this ſeale is the Name of God written in their foreheads, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.1. This Name or ſeale of God writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their foreheads, is an outward real indicies, and ſigne in their practiſe, that they are armed, ſealed and united in the life and power of God, that was the ſeale or ſigne of the Typical
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:32682:47"/>Paſſe-over, this of the real and true Paſſe-over: The Iſraelites ſealed were Gods firſt born in a Type, that is, his firſt fruits, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by a Lamb unto himſelf, and theſe are redeemed from among men, and are the firſt fruits unto God, and to the Lamb. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.4. That Mark, Seal, and Name, which is oppoſite and contrary to the Seal and Name of God, written in the foreheads of his people, is the mark and name of the beaſt in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads or hands that worſhip the beaſt; <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.16. <hi>and</hi> 14.9. This name of the beaſt is the ſeal of ſlavery, the mark of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and the manifeſtation of the life and power of the beaſt in profeſſion or practiſe; which is the power of Antichriſt work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto bondage againſt Chriſt, as the Sorcerers reſiſted <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seventhly, All the Congregation of Iſrael was commanded to keep the Paſſe-over, <hi>v.</hi> 49. and they kept it as the Lord commanded. So all the true Iſrael, that is, all the people of God, muſt ſpeedily prepare and obſerve the true Paſs-over: All that ſhall not faithfully prepare and obſerve the true Paſs-over, that is, all that ſhall not manifeſt the life and power of God in the unity of the ſpirit of freedom from all bondage and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, are really (as all they were in the Type that did not) Aegyptians, ſons of <hi>Cham,</hi> children of the curſe, improvident for their own and all families, deny the faith of God, and have no power of God, nor any ſeal or ſign of it, but are ruled and governed by the ſpirit of bondage unto all ſins, ſlavery, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of body and ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Secondly, All the people or God muſt ſpeedily prepare and obſerve the true Paſs-over, becauſe as God paſt through all Aegypt, and ſmote all the firſt born both of man and beaſt in every family where the Type was not kept; ſo God will as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly paſs through the earth, and ſmite all Families where the life and power of God appears not in the unity of the ſpirit of freedom, and viſit upon it and them, not Aegypts, but Sodoms, and Babels, and back-ſliding Jeruſalems ſins, and the bloud of all that have bin ſlain upon the earth, and the bloud of all that have bin wronged and oppreſſed, and the blaſphemous, atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, ſortiſh, and brutiſh opinions and practiſes of hypocrites and formal profeſſors upon it and them; and the breach of faith (in thoſe that have broken their juſt faith) to God and man; and

               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:32682:49"/>their defections that have fallen from all righteouſneſs, and from all life and power of it; and their unrighteouſneſs, that have kept righteouſneſs, and truth, and goodneſs (in relation to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual forms and things) in bondage, and chains of darkneſs and ignorance in their own judgements, upon them and it, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve the earth in circum-ambient and ſharp deſtruction, ſharp as ſickles. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.16, 17.</p>
            <p>Eightly, The keeping of that Paſs-over, was the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Iſraels typical-being and exiſtence, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.2. <hi>This moneth ſhall be unto you the begining of moneths, it ſhall be the firſt moneth of the yeer;</hi> Man was earth the firſt day, but that earth was not man until the ſixt day; So Iſrael was the people of God before (as they were dead earth, and duſt of bondage) but never the people of God redeemed in a type, until the lamb was killed, and until they all with one accord kept the Paſs-over, as God commanded, and then, and therefore God commanded Iſrael, <hi>that that moneth ſhould be the begining of all moneths unto them, and the firſt moneth of the yeer,</hi> becauſe it was unto them really the begining of their being: So the keeping of the true Paſs-over, ſhall be the firſt begining of the being and exiſtence of the true people of God; They are Gods people, as Iſrael was before they kept the Paſs-over, that is, as dead earth, and ſcattered duſt; they are not, nor have order, matter, or form, nor manifeſt any life of obedience, as a people redeemed; dead trees bring not forth fruits of life and power, nor plants of bondage righteous obedience; What obedience they do manifeſt (which is little, and in bondage) is as perſons (<hi>Jonas</hi> might pray, when in bondage in the belly of hell) but perform (as families, people, and churches) nothing really, becauſe they are (as Iſrael before they kept the Paſs-over) in bondage, as perſons, families, people, and Churches. Strict profeſſors, and pretenders to freedom and righteouſneſs (of all nations) were ever many, but Iſrael was free by birth and promiſe, and a figure of the true free-born: Profeſſors were and are four ſorts, The firſt were pretenders in all nations to freedom and righteouſneſs, who notwithſtanding were not of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſubſtance after the fleſh; and to whom no promiſe of bleſſing, that is, of freedom from the curſe was made; So now, there are many ſtrict profeſſors and pretenders
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:32682:49"/>to freedom of all nations, who not withſtanding manifeſt no ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſubſtance of <hi>Abraham,</hi> no true righteouſneſs in practiſe, which is the ſubſtance of the free-born of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Aegyptians (<hi>Pharaohs</hi> ſervants and ſorcerers eſpecially) approved (and did falſly) that which <hi>Moſes</hi> did, and practiſed quite contrary; they were not <hi>Abrahams,</hi> but <hi>Chams</hi> ſeed after the fleſh, the peculiar people of the curſe in the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis to Iſrael; ſo uſurpers over the free-born, and all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſeal of the ſpirit of Sorcery, and the mark of the power of the beaſt to enſlave the free-born, profeſs what the free-born do, and practiſe quite contrary, and are the peculiar people of the curſe, in an antitheſis to the true Iſrael; The curſe is bondage and ſlavery, the bleſſing redemption unto freedom: The power of the curſe is diffidence, ſlaviſh fear, and ſubjection to the ſpirit of bondage unto ſin, and deſtruction of body and ſpirit; The form of the bleſſing is faith, freedom, and life in the power and obedience of God.</p>
            <p>A third ſort (not Hebrews, nor Aegyptians, but Neuters) ſet the Ark in one Temple with Dagon, and in profeſſion ſerve God, Dagon in practiſe; They ſerve God by ſleeping, and to that end, creep into ſtricteſt ſocieties of Profeſſion (as into ſleeping holes) that they may onely ſleep (as Dormice) and do nothing; They ſerve God and Dagon, as the rebellious Ephramites did, <hi>Judg.</hi> 12.2. who when they were called upon to free the people of God and themſelves front bondage, ſlept and harkned not; and after, when God by <hi>Jephtah</hi> had delivered his people without them, they falſly pretended great wrong from <hi>Jephtah</hi> in not calling them, whereas he had called them, and they would not hearken: So Neuters ſerve God by a ſlothful and ſleepy profeſſion; Thoſe Ephramites ſlandred <hi>Jephtah</hi> for his faithful ſervice in freeing Iſrael, and gathered themſelves together to burn down his houſe upon him; ſo Neuters ſerve Dagon in ſlandring and deſtroying ſuch as hate ſloth and ſlaviſh fear, and are diligent and faithful: They ſay <hi>ſibboleth</hi> in a ſleepy profeſſion, but they cannot frame to pronounce <hi>ſhibboleth</hi> in practiſe: <hi>Iudg.</hi> 12.6.</p>
            <p>The fourth ſort were Iſraelites, <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of freedom, and people of God in a type, the peculiar people, in whom the promiſe of bleſſing unto all Nations was
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:32682:50"/>made, and <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſubſtance after the fleſh, in an Antitheſis to the Aegyptians; Iſrael had the fleſh, but not the faith of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> So the true Iſrael ſeem to hold forth the ſpiritual ſubſtance of <hi>Abraham</hi> (faith and obedience) and are the true people of God in antitheſis to all that receive the ſeal of the power of the beaſt; and in reference to the type, but not in relation to truth in ſincerity; They hold forth the outward carcaſs of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith and obedienc (or a ſhadow of it) but not the life and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith and obedience. Gods people are ſincere or ſeeming: All Creatures (clean and unclean) that came into the Ark, were a type of the people of God, manifeſting faith and obedience outwardly, but there's no mention of more then <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Sem</hi> onely that were ſincere: All that kept the Paſs-over in Aegypt, were a figure of Gods people, but there's no mention of above five or ſix that were ſincere, and but two onely entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the land of promiſe, the reſt received again the ſpirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and periſht, and fell by ſlaviſhneſs: So Iſraelites (like <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel</hi>) indeed, are few, ſcarce viſible, but have, and had ever an inward principle of life and power, obſcure and infirm, becauſe of bondage; their faith and obedience is like that Prophets that was ſent to propheſie againſt the Altar in Bethel, and returned back an other way, who did go, propheſied, and returned back an other way; but before he had throughly done his work, he <hi>ſat him down under an Oak, and then</hi> (contrary to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand) <hi>returned back to Bethel, wherefore a Lyon met him and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e him;</hi> Some ſmall hid ſincerity there is in their actions, but if they do any work of God, they either leave it off before they well begin it, or ſit down before it is half done; The beſt of them are like the barren fig-tree, full of fruitleſs leaves of profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; If a man ſeek (as the Prophet did <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.) ripe fruit, he may weary or deſtroy himſelf before he find any: Their fruit falls before it is ripe, yet they put forth ſome ripe if a man could find it; they deſiſt from all good actions before they perfect them, or tranſmit them ſeemingly imperfect, becauſe they are outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the power of bondage. The ſeeming people of God manifeſt outward faith and obedience (as the generality of creatures that came into the Ark did in a Type, and) as the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Iſrael that harkned to <hi>Moſes</hi> when he was firſt ſent
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:32682:50"/>did, but their faith and obedience is not ſealed with any life and power inward or outward, nor ſhall be, until they prepare to keep the true Paſ-over: Iſrael at firſt harkned, and then gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally revolted, and would not harken; their harkning was no obedience, becauſe not ſealed, and what is not ſealed, is in no force or being, but their diſobedience in not hearkning, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt God; So Gods people ſeem forward to harken and to act unto righteouſneſs and freedom from the curſe, and then immediately relinquiſh freed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Neither can a fountain of bondage bring forth any work of Freedom; Their continued breaches of faith, and their quiet and peaceable doing and ſuffering of all unrighteouſneſs, and their oft revoltings, are manifeſtly the works of bondage, and do manifeſt that all their obedience are real works of bondage; They ſeek juſt things for and from ſlaviſh and unjuſt principles and ends, and ſeek to accompliſh thoſe ends by head-long and raſh means, and their beſt actions being ſubject to unjuſt ends, and under the powers and forms of bondage, the matter muſt needs be the matter of thoſe forms, and not of the free ſpirit in the power of God. That ſome ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere are among them alters not their condition of bondage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they alſo are outwardly in bondage, and outwardly not ſeen, nor viſible; their righteouſneſs and freedom is inward, and ſo ſecret, and ſecret things belong to God: They that wore ſincere of Iſrael in bondage, did not alter the condition of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality, for they were all in bondage; But as the Law by tranſgreſſion is the power of ſin, ſo their ſervice and obedience by back-ſliding is the power of the curſe of bondage, for they could not revolt, did they not firſt ſeem to ſtand, nor betray the ſincere, did they not ſeem to hold forth faith and obedience, nor be nigh unto curſing, were it not that they were once enlightned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. therefore the people of God are ſo far from being or begining of order, matter, or form of a people, called to the life and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:32682:51"/>form of freedom and righteouſneſs, which is of God, that their ſeeming form, their ſervice and obedience, is the occaſion, and their deflecting from it the real cauſe of their being under the form, or power of the ſpirit of bondage. There is no mention of any ſervice to God, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> ever did in Egypt, before they kept the Paſſe-over; for it was impoſſible for them to ſerve God before they were or had being or beginning of order, matter, or form of righteouſneſſe and freedom, but of bondage unto ſin and ſlavery only in a type. So the true <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as perſons, families, people, and Churches did never, nor can or ſhall ever do any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to God, at leaſt, in the cleer evidence of the life and power of God, until they by and in their anti-typical families prepare and keep the true Paſſeover: neither ſhall they have being or beginning of order, matter, or form, in the power of true righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and freedom, until they be called out of the power of bondage into the freedom and power of God, receiving the ſeal of the Name of God, &amp;c. and they onely ſhall bee the firſt fruits unto God, and to the Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.21.</p>
            <p>A ſtone, or clodd of earth, caſt by a ſtrong hand, flies as faſt as the ſwifteſt creatures that have life and motion in themſelves: ſo the people of God act juſt things vigorouſly, for their own private ends (ſingly) of which, did they ſeek them in the joynt good and ſafety of each other, and by right means, they could not miſſe: and their outward motives failing, they fall as a clodd of earth, quit freedom; and if peril appears, their hearts (like <hi>Nabals</hi>) are dead as ſtones, but they not only lick up the vomit of a ſlaviſh ſpirit, but bend the power of it, in reſiſtance, againſt God. They hide their treacheries and apoſtaſies with fig-leaves of deceits, adding fraud to unfaithfulneſſe, and enſnare and betray thoſe that are ſincere, and themſelves (in them) to deſtruction and ſlavery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſrael</hi> told <hi>Sampſon</hi> plainly, that they were come down to bind him, and to <hi>deliver him into the hands of the Philiſtims,</hi> and that they would bind him faſt, and deliver him, (that is, betray him,) and they did ſo, <hi>Iudges</hi> 15.12, 13. but the people of God deal not ſo ſincerely and truly with thoſe that are faithfull and ſincere amongſt them: They indeed bind them faſt in cords of bondage, and betray them, but tell them not they will do ſo,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:32682:51"/>they need not, they have many examples to warn them, <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets; reaſon and experience tells them that as <hi>Iſrael</hi> bound <hi>Sampſon</hi> and betrayed him, and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and in them, all Iſrael into the power of ſlavery and death, ſo all that the people of God do, or can do (in bondage) by any Engagement, is but to bind thoſe that are ſincere and faithful, in ſtrong cords of ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and death, and betray them to deſtruction and ſlaughter: And this their trecherous diſſervice thus quitted, they confine and terminate in outward ſtrict form; of profeſſion, and their own corrupt intereſts, until opportunity be given that they may again ſeek (for ſlaviſh ends) juſt things by head-long and raſh means, and again betray thoſe that are faithful to ſlaughter, and themſelves to ſlavery; So they ſcarce leave any name or being of thoſe that are ſincere (as few were left when the floud came in a Type) They rally not, but to revolt, deſert, and betray thoſe that are faithful, and oppoſe baſe excuſes to faith and obedience: <hi>Iſrael</hi> heard gladly the meſſage of their deliverance, and then all (both Elders and People (ſo ſoon as reſiſted) revolted, and were ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all over Aegypt under the power of bondage more then ever; God ſent a ſecond meſſage, but they in no wiſe harkned, <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.9. They had ſomthing elſe to mind then <hi>Moſes;</hi> they muſt either ſubmit to bear, or be beaten; it was their living, their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and they muſt follow it; The people of God (bidden to the great Supper, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.17.) begin all with one conſent, to make excuſe; <hi>one had bought five yoak of Oxen, another a houſe,</hi> &amp;c. So the people of God called out of bondage, at firſt ſeem forward to harken and engage for juſt Freedom; but then the firſt noiſe of Fear (before they ſee any danger) puts them all to retreat, and ſcatters them under the power of bondage more then ever; the firſt brunt (before it approach or come neer them) breaks their ſpirit; <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſent with a ſecond meſſage, but they did not harken for cruel bondage, their ſervile ſpirits made bondage matter of excuſe, and a ſtrong Bar againſt their deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from it; The Lord ſent to call thoſe that were bidden to the great Supper, and they alſo harkned not, but oppoſed the power of bondage againſt the power of God in making excuſes; an excuſe is a ſhaking off, or a caſting out; and they by making excuſes, did ſhake off God and his power for their deliverance:
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:32682:52"/>So the people of God caſt off God, oppoſe his meſſages, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt his power by ſlaviſh excuſes; They oppoſe againſt their juſt faith to God and man (broken by their trechery) the unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of others, to excuſe their own; They through greedy ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice betray the true Iſrael, and themſelves, their liberties, eſtates, and entire Beings, to periſh and be deſtroyed by ſlavery (as <hi>Judas</hi> betrayed the Truth and himſelf for money) and then cover that bitter root of all evil, with falſe pretenſes of Frugal Providence: Their occaſions obſtruct their obedience, and their callings and buſineſs are meer inſtruments emiſſary to ſlavery: Neuters (that out-ſit the time in ſleeping, and cenſure all that are not ſlothful) excuſe their trechery under pretenſe of wary and ſecure acting: they are moderate men, who ſit ſtill, and ſuffer the Lands (like <hi>Sodoms</hi>) ſwift deſtruction, whiles they drink the ſweet, and eat the fat of it, and receive the States pay for ſo doing.</p>
            <p>The people of God will not put the ſtrength of their little finger to remove (really and indeed) the leaſt burden, (though they groan under the greateſt that ever were, of which the Aegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptian were but ſhaddows) Why? Their burdens are ſo great and many, and their ſlaviſh fear ſuggeſts more, and greater; yet they are forward enough to ſeek juſt Freedom and Righteouſneſs, and juſt things for their own ends (ſingly) to enſlave, and by head-long and raſh means (like <hi>Nadabs</hi> and <hi>Abihu's</hi> ſtrange fires) to deſtroy themſelves. But if any meſſage or command from God recal them to ſeek their own ſafeties and freedom (not in their own ſingle, but of one another) and to do all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the right order, and rule of God, they reject it, and them them that bring it; propoſe what, and from whom you will, they'l not meddle with it, nor engage in what's good: They have bin burnt enough; It urged, or preſſed, they ſummon all the powers of the curſe of covetouſneſs, ſloth, and ſlaviſh fears, to make excuſes; ſwords befit not their hands nor hearts, but burdens and ſharp ſcourges their ſervil backs: Why ſay they, <hi>Are Zeba and Zalmunna</hi> (the keepers of our Captivity) <hi>in your hands?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 8. Why ſervile back-ſliding Iſrael, can your trecherous and bas;e excuſes, or churliſh ſlaviſhneſs, prevent Gods purpoſe to free his people, or free your ſelves from the curſe and deſtruction of bondage? The Lord declared expreſly, <hi>that none</hi>

            <p>The fearful and unbelieving ſpies, and all <hi>Iſrael</hi> (by believing them) brought evil reports upon the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the guilt of moſt degenerous, and baſe wickedneſs upon themſelves: they feared ſtrong Cities, and tall ſtatures of men, more than confided in the living God; and that fear deſtroyed (except <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Ioſhua</hi> that ſought to bear up their ſlaviſh ſpirits) every man of them; when <hi>Caleb</hi> told them they were well able to overcome they all lift up their voyces and cryed, and wept fore, and were wholly routed and ſlain (without any enemy, or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger neer them) by meer ſlaviſhneſs, all above twenty years old (women not excepted) fell, and periſhed through the power of the curſe of their own ſlaviſh ſpirit; when <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Ioſhua</hi> ſought to bear up their backſliding ſpirits, <hi>all Iſrael bid ſtone them with ſtones,</hi> rebelled, and gathered together againſt God <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.9.35. that is, they gathered together in the power of bondage againſt the power of God, for their freedom, and deliverance; So all that the people of God (in bondage) do, or can do, is but to begin ſeemingly in the ſpirit, and end in the fleſh; to ſeek Freedom and righteouſneſs by head-long, and raſh means, and for their own ſiniſter and baſe ends increaſe bondage, deſtroy themſelves, and reſiſt God: They bring (if oppoſed eſpecially) only evil reports upon all right means, and ends of their deliverance, and project nothing but baſe excuſes and cavils (the fruits of wicked fears) their hope (like <hi>Nabals</hi> heart) is dead as a ſtone; they quit faith; and their love to true righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and Freedom leaves them, and they it: why ſay they its in vain to ſtir, our juſt ends (the more we act) are the farther off, and to accompliſh them (by any means) is impoſſible; What ſhould we run our ſelves into danger for and need not? we ſee clearly that to ſtir in this way is but to deſtroy our ſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remedy, and for our parts we have ſeen a great deale of means uſed, and much pains taken, and no good has come of it, wee'l labour to ſeek God, keep in compaſſe of our own callings, and leave the affairs of the State to thoſe they do belong, the times are ſuffering times, and call not to ſtir, but ſit ſtill, we muſt

The rule and form of a free people is the Law, of Law, Reaſon; of Reaſon, the Word by the work of his free ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; the elementary form and rule of the law of Nature and Reaſon, is the Scripture; But the matter (the people of God) and their forms (Law, Reaſon, and Scriptures) and the order of both matter and form, are kept in chains of ſlaviſh diſ-uſe, dead to Freedom and Life, alive and active unto bondage and death; as all Iſrael (living in bondage) acted unto bondage onely, The moſt juſt Law is but a bond-ſlave to Will and Power, Will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reaſon is the form of it; Right (if any be or ſeem) is an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect contingent, or a work of Bribery, or of by-reſpects, and not of the Law: for there can be no right effect from that cauſe, whereof Reaſon is not the Form and Power: Reaſon is the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of (Law-natural) the Image of God in man, fallen (when man fell) under the power of bondage and death: Dead bodies (not preſently, but in time) wholy corrupt and putrifie; So this Image,

            <p>Thirdly, The Scriptures are not (but ought to be, and ſhall be) the elementary form and power of reaſon, and of the Image of God in man; that is, they are properly, and ſhall be really, the Conduit and Inſtrument by which the Spirit of life (in the Word of God) ſhall convey light of life into the Image of God, and into the form of it (Reaſon) But the Scriptures are alſo in

The Scripture is not (by ſtricteſt pretenders to it) extended to Perſons, Families, and People (as the elementary form and rule of their Law, and Government, as Perſons, Families, and people.

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:32682:57"/>only, but the inward ſeal of the free Spirit of life in Chriſt the Lamb) and this is to eat the fleſh and ſubſtance of the Lamb: Its ſoon gathered what hungry men are doing that have meat ſet before them, and are ſilent; When all free people (the true Iſrael) ſhall be gathered together in their anti-typical families to eat the fleſh, and ſubſtance of the Lamb after this manner, as all Iſrael were by their families in a Type) and ſhall thus conveen to take real (not verbal) councel to accompliſh theſe ends; then the yoke of bondage upon them, and upon all they are, and have, ſhall be broken for ever; then the ſeal of conſtant conformity, or real ſincerity (in true righteouſneſs of freedom) ſhall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven upon their ſpirits; then the vanity (that is, the nullity of right uſe) and ſlaviſh diſ-uſe (to which the people of God, and what they are and have is ſubjected) and the bondage of corruption under which they, their juſt rights, and eſtates, the Image of God in them, their Laws, Power, Scriptures, and the whole Creation groan, and travel in pain to be delivered, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.21. ſhall be taken off for ever, and their, and the creatures ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire and expectation of the manifeſtation of the ſons of God, <hi>v.</hi> 15. ſhall be then accompliſhed; that ſhall be the time of the great Marriage-Supper of the Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.7, 9. And theſe ſhall be the high and ſerious tranſactions of this half hours ſilence: More was done (in a Type) in that ſhort ſpace by the ſeeming weakeſt means, then had bin done in all the time before; and more ſhall be done by the ſeeming weakeſt means in this half hours ſilence, then hath bin ſince time had begining. Actual redemption is the hardeſt work that ever was, yet done upon the eaſieſt terms; What eaſier terms of redemption can be to hungry weary bond-ſlaves, then to ſay go home to Supper, you have bin (heretofore in rigous of cruel bondage) ever reſtleſs, go home and hence-forward reſt quiet for ever? God offers the ſame terms (in ſubſtance) to the true Iſrael, to redeem them, and the whole Creation from bondage unto vanity and corruption; As if he ſhould ſay, Iſrael (in Aegypt) was oppreſt, and murdered with heavie burdens, and by rigour of cruel bondage; you really and indeed, I redeemed them naturally, and will redeem you ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually; Free grace freely given them, was all the ranſom they paid, and Free grace from me (the greateſt that was ever) and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:32682:57"/>your acceptance (in it) ſhall be all your ranſom required from you: Their task was moſt eaſie and acceptable; yours the eaſieſt and moſt acceptable (in truth and ſubſtance.) I bid them go home, reſt, and refreſh themſelves for ever; Go ye home, and be free from all burdens, reſt and refreſh your ſelves for ever. A dog did not open his mouth againſt any of them, nor ſhall againſt you: I did not buſie their memories with many obſervations (onely to prepare and eat the Paſs-over) neither be you buſied (<hi>Martha</hi>-like) about many things, but mind the only one thing neceſſary (to follow the Lamb whitherſoever he goeth, and) to do and obſerve (in your Oecunomical conſults and executions) all which God and the Lamb ſaith; That was the firſt feaſt and ſacrifice that ever was kept in Iſrael, they kept it by their families, (the firſt ſubjects of begining and being of all Power and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.) I (in like manner) call, and redeem you (by your families) out of the greateſt and moſt ſlaviſh tribulation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction that ever was, to keep the ſame feaſt in truth and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and your anti-typical families (ſo called and redeemed) ſhall be (really and indeed) the firſt ſubjects of begining and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all true Power and Government.</p>
            <p>Government is the intenſe Order of Agreement; Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Agreements are (conjunct) political: Forms of right Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are elementary or literal, and virtual or eſſential: Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary or literal form, is the figure or tenour of the matter of the Inſtrument; Virtual or eſſential form, is the ſubſcribing or conſigning of force, figure, and matter in one act: Literal forms ought to expreſs the whole neceſſary ſubſtance in ſummary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pactneſs; wherefore becauſe no Inſtrument is more neceſſary, I inſert this Pattern.</p>

            <p>Laſtly, Right Government is the intenſe order of a right A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement; This intenſe order is an intermediate preſſing forward (in the righteouſneſs of life and freedom) from the bounds (from which) to the bounds (to which) a free people muſt act
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:32682:60"/>and move; Righteouſneſs is either of bondage or freedom: Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and Freedom, and their righteouſneſs, differ as light and darkneſs; The righteouſneſs of bondage (in the people of God) is lame, and imperfect, meer impoſtury, reprobate righteouſneſs of corruption; <hi>Iſhmael</hi> the bond-womans ſon (with his mother) to be caſt out: but their righteouſneſs of Freedom ſhall be (at leaſt as to outward conformity) firm and conſtant. The good works of bondage in the people of God, are dead carcaſſes of righteouſneſs, and therefore have an an appearance (in their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive act eſpecially) and ſo their impreſſive power of bondage, is leſs viſible; but the intenſe power of bondage in the beſt righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the people of God, is in its intermediate act appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: For as thorns obſtruct and choak the beſt ſeed, ſo bondage and its forms (reſpect to private ends, and diſreſpect to duty and conſcience) kills the very impreſſive life of all righteouſneſs: Therefore their dead and ſlaviſh righteouſneſs (for they have no other) cannot reach any ſupreme end of the righteouſneſs of life and freedom; but bondage forms and ſteers its intermediate, firſt and laſt courſe to ſlavery, ſin, and death: for dead men to do the works of the living, and for Gods people in bondage of corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and death, to do the righteouſneſs of life and freedom, is impoſſible: Their beſt actions are but good words, and theſe meer deceits and trecheries: Such forms, ſuch effects: but the powers of bondage are the forms in which the people of God, and the whole Creation (as the matter) are ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ected: therefore all their righteouſneſs is the righteouſneſs of the power of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, a baſe off-ſpring of pride, avarice, and vain-glory; a vile inſtrument to advance empty forms, a ſervant to perfideous ſloth and apoſtaſie, a proſtitute to vice, and bond-ſervant to baſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes. The rigour of Aegyptian bundage killed Iſraels fruits after the fleſh (their children) ſo ſoon as born, and captivated all that lived, in continual bondage: but this vehement rigour of real bondage, ſuffers not the people of God, nor their beſt righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, to have intenſe motion, being, nor begining of life and freedom, but of perfect captivity only to ſlaviſh diſ-uſe, ſin, and death.</p>
            <p>The ſincereſt, and their beſt righteouſneſs, are (like <hi>Iſhmael</hi>) in bondage partly, and partly free; <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was free-born by
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:32682:60"/>the fathers ſide, but by <hi>Hagar</hi> the bond-woman: Wherefore ſubjecting none, and ſubject, and in bondage to none, his hand was againſt every man, and every mans hand againſt him; So the ſincere, and their righteouſneſs are of God their Father, and ſo free and perfect, but outwardly of <hi>Hagar</hi> the bond-woman; therefore their free Spirit bows not its knee to bondage; but (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Hagar</hi> the bond-womans ſons) the ſpirit of bondage, not the free ſpirit, coucheth to all burdens, and reſiſteth in all things the free Spirit of God: Therefore (as wild men like <hi>Iſhmael</hi>) they reſiſt, but ſubdue not, and are reſiſted, but are not ſubdued by all vaſſals of bondage, and their, and its corruptions; and bring forth no righteouſneſs of life and freedom into manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being; becauſe they are free, and live (partly) and are (partly) dead, and in bondage.</p>
            <p>Righteouſneſs of freedom, is the good works of a people equally legitimate and free (not as the people of God were and are in Aegypt) by promiſe only, and really, and indeed the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt miſerable ſlaves that ever were, nor as <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was; and the moſt ſincere are (free by the fathers ſide only) but by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother as <hi>Davids</hi> fathers houſe was in a type free in Iſrael. Jeruſalem deſcending ſhall be the only free mother (as <hi>Evah</hi> of all the living) of all living branches of the Tree of life (the free-born of God that ſhall bring forth perfect fruits of life and freedom. The integrity of Primitive times did anti-type <hi>Adams</hi> and <hi>Evahs</hi> innocency, and typified that equally legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and free righteouſneſs of the free-born ſons of God, by that City, the Lambs Bride. Mans fall prefigured the general fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away from the Primitive Churches, and ſecond <hi>Adams</hi> firſt righteouſneſs, which general Apoſtaſie and corruption of all fleſh (in the anti-type) is now full, as <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and his off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprings general apoſtaſie (in a type) was full when the floud came: The Ark (made of one wood into manſions or rooms) ſhaddowing forth the order of the families which ſhall be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally redeemed unto freedom) brought forth (1656 yeers after the firſt tree of life) its firſt fruits of life, in a type: So the true Ark (the tree of life in anti-type and truth) ſhall then bring forth (and not till then) its firſt fruits of righteouſneſs of life and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, when the order of its manſions (that is, the prefigured
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:32682:61"/>myſtical families there) ſhall be compleated and full: The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs (which is now, and hath bin) is the righteouſneſs of falſe appearance, covetouſneſs, and filthy corruptions of bondage, born and begotten by and for baſe deſignes and ends; the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of illegitimacy, and ſeed of inceſt, conceived (like <hi>Moah</hi> and <hi>Ammon</hi>) in the heat and zeal of blind and empty profeſſion, and bloudy hypocriſie, the fruit of perfideous trechery and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. If any righteouſneſs of life and freedom hath bin, or is, that Righteouſneſs, or they that produce it, have or hath bin, or is the firſt fruits to God and the Lamb: but the Text is expreſs, That the ſealed Tribes or Families of Iſrael, ſhall be the firſt fruits to God and the Lamb: There was no righteouſneſs of deliverance from the curſe of deſtruction, bondage, and death of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin (in a type) until thoſe creatures that were ſaved (the ſhadow of the free people of God) came (as it were by their families) into the Ark after their kind; and there hath not bin any perfect (but dead, ſpurious, and illegitimate) righteouſneſs; no righteouſneſs of deliverance, life, and freedom from real de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, ſin, and death, nor ſhall be any, until the free people come into the true Ark by their anti-typical Tribes and Families, and poſſeſs their proper manſions in truth and ſubſtance. The people of God (abſolute free) and their righteouſneſs ſhall be equally legitimate in relation to God their father, and in relation to the new policy or City (their mother) deſcending, which ſhall be free; And they, and their righteouſneſs ſhall be perfect (as their heavenly father is perfect, and as their mother deſcending from God out of heaven ſhall be perfect) Perfect, not of the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, but after the pattern and image of the mind of God (as the Tabernacle was the figure of that pattern in the Mount, and as the Rain-bow is the Image of the Sun) ſo they ſhall be created and formed (by the free Spirit of life in Chriſt) after the Image of God; For the Creator, Former, and Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, is not the creature, thing formed, or houſe: Howbeit, God ſhall dwell in them more fully. The perfection of a free people and of their righteouſneſs, conſiſts in an impreſs, intermediate, and expreſs act of Life and Freedom, but the laſt gives their and its denomination and being; and the firſt two (without the third) are properly the righteouſneſs of bondage; This perfect
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:32682:61"/>righteouſneſs of a Free people is a commutative three-fold righteouſneſs of deliverance from evil, in evil, and out of evil of bondage; a figure of this righteouſneſs was in <hi>Moſes,</hi> his viſiting of his brethren three times, the firſt time he went forth, he (ſeeing an <hi>Egyptian</hi> and an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> at ſtrife) ſlew the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> and freed the <hi>Iſraelite</hi> (in a Type) from evil of bondage; The ſecond time he went forth he (ſeeing two <hi>Iſraelites</hi> at ſtrife) ſought to reconcile and unite them, and ſo to releive and ſupport them in the evil of bondage; Theſe actions were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the righteouſneſs of bondage (for <hi>Moſes</hi> was then in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage) and therefore it inſlaved him and them, and hazarded his life much more; for which cauſe he fled, and left them forty yeers. Men may not be faithful indeed, nor do impreſs, or intenſe works of Freedom in bondage: but extremely hazard their lives, or eſtates, they, &amp; their righteouſnes muſt be corupt by conſtraint or they muſt act (if ſtrictly faithful) ſingle, For the people of God in bondage (having no order, nor unity) deceive and betray each other. <hi>Moſes</hi> in his firſt viſit acted but with one <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him, and that one betrayed him: The ſecond time he act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but with two and one of them betrayed him, and he fled for his life (ſuch are the perfidious treacheries &amp; deceits of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of bondage) but <hi>Moſes</hi> did not deſiſt but (ſent) came the third time, and Freed <hi>Iſrael</hi> and their intire beings out of bondage; all <hi>Iſrael</hi> therein joyned with him, and this his, and their joynt work, was the proper righteouſneſs of Freedom (in a Type) To avert evils of bondage (in bondage) or relieve and ſupport thoſe that groan under the rigour of it, and reſt ſo (being works of bondage) ſtrengthens the power and rage of it, and depreſſeth all means of deliverance; So <hi>Moſes</hi> did, and fled for his life, and left all <hi>Iſrael</hi> deſperately helpleſs, and worſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved than ever. <hi>Ahimelech</hi> relieved <hi>David</hi> with the ſhew-bread and <hi>Goliahs</hi> Sword, which was a very juſt and good work, yet it occaſioned that <hi>Ahimelech</hi> and all the Preiſts of the Lord and their City were cut off, and deſtroyed man, woman, and child: ſuch are the violent evils of the bondage of corruption, that the beſt and moſt perfect righteouſneſs of bondage, cauſeth (through corruption) the worſt evils and effects, becauſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the beſt things is the moſt deſtructive corruption that can be,</p>
            <pb n="108" facs="tcp:32682:62"/>
            <p> Its the greateſt and moſt deſparate hazard of utter ruine to a mans life or eſtate, to be conſcientious and exactly faithful in bondage: Alſo performances of impreſs and intenſe acts of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in bondage, without the expreſs act of the righteouſneſs of Freedom out of bondage, is dead and imperfect righteouſneſs, and meer impoſtury, which deceives and hardens (like the works of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Sorcerers) all mens hearts in vanities and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of bondage; For whiles they follow and mind ſorceries and deceits, imperfect righteouſneſs of relief, or ſupport in bondage, they dream not, nor once think of any legitimate or perfect righteouſneſs of Life and Freedom out of bondage: Theſe rotten deceits deſtroy or hazard (as in <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prieſts of the the Lord) their Lives, Families, and Eſtates: for the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of relief and ſupport in bondage, and not of Freedom out of it, rouſeth up the power and rigour of it (as a ſleepy lyon) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them: he that pricks a ſleepy lyon muſt alſo kill him, or be ſure to be deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>This corruption of bondage under which the Creation groans and travels in pain to be delivered out of it, is briefly this; The Creation was at firſt ſubſervient to bruit beaſts, till man (a figure of the Creatures Freedom) was made the head of all creatures; and thus far the creature was not properly ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto vanity under bondage of corruption: Satan and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent (the parents of all corruption of bondage, ſin, and death,) co-inſpired into the ſpirit of man the corrupt nature of bruit beaſts (from the bruit beaſt the ſerpent, the mother of ſin in a type) and of fallen Angels (from Satan the Father of ſin and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy corruptions of bondage:) So the ſpirit of man (the head of the Creation) became bruitiſh, and diveliſh, and then the creature was properly ſubjected unto vanity and bondage of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: The corruption of bruitiſhneſs in man did corrupt, and darken the Image of God (reaſon, righteous judgement) in man, as denſe earth darkens the light of the Sun, and ſatanical corruption impreſſed the Image of Satan (that is, an oppoſite, corrupt, and contrary light of reaſon and judgement) in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of man. This two-fold fall, from which (God and Nature) to which (the Beaſt and Satan) was not full till the Floud came, at which time all fleſh was corrupt, the earth filled with violence,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:32682:62"/>and the thoughts of mens hearts only evil continually: But this was but a ſhadow of the bondage of corruption, under which the whole Creation, and the free people now groan and travel, and muſt travel in pain to be delivered out of it. Man then fell from the firſt <hi>Adams</hi> righteouſneſs, now from the righteouſneſs of the firſt and ſecond <hi>Adam:</hi> Then the creature was ſubjected to all ſorts of evil beaſts to ſerve them whiles they devoured the moſt innocent and beſt creatures; Men are now thoſe evil beaſts that devour the beſt men: <hi>Pharaohs</hi> lean beaſts ate the fat; Fire went out of the bryars, and devoured the Cedars of Lebanon; ſo it ever was, but is now indeed: The thoughts of mens hearts were then only evil continually, now their thoughts and works are continually only evil; Now all fleſh is wholy corrupt in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Judgement (as it was then in a Type.) The ſpirits of men were then corrupt after the ſimilitude of their parents (the beſt, the Serpent their mother, and Satan their father; but now expreſly: Judgement is onely prepoſterous, and precedes know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and ſentence goes before examination. Right Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the ſourſe of Righteouſneſs, but all Judgement is now meer rottenneſs and corruption. M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Prophet writs to the Church of <hi>Smyrna, that the devil ſhould caſt ſome of them into priſon Revel.</hi> 2.8. but theſe caſt many of the moſt faithful into Priſon, yea all the faithful, their Intereſts, external Liberties, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences are (by them kept in greateſt Impriſonment of real bondage, that ever was) They give Liberty of Conſcience (to the Free people) in profeſſion, they may ſacrifice (as to outward form) the fruit of the ground, or of their flocks, herein is no

The wicked Steward laid violent hands upon a poor man, took him by the throat, and ſaid, pay me what thou oweſt me: But Bond-maſters and Oppreſſors now lay violent hands upon the periſhing poor, and middle ſort, take them by their throats, and ſay, pay us what you ow us not, and what you have not to pay, pay us (what by right and neceſſity is due to your ſelves) that little reliefe the ſupport of your lives and of the lives of your Families; The <hi>Phariſees</hi> layd the Croſſe (the inſtrument wherewith they crucified and killed Chriſt) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Simon,</hi> and compelled him to bear it; So theſe lay heavie bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of cruel bondage (the inſtrument wherewith they crucifie the poor, and impoveriſh the rich) upon poor and rich, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel thoſe (by day labor) and thoſe (with their eſtates) to bear theſe curſed burdens of violence to crucifie and kill themſelves: Theſe are the burdens of cruelties, the corruptions of real bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, under which the creature is ſubjected, and under which the Creation, and they that have (by the Fathers ſide) the firſt fruits of the Spirit, groan, and travel in pain to be delivered. As it was in the daies of <hi>Noah,</hi> ſo now at this time, in which the Son of man (Chriſt myſtical) is coming to raign in his myſtical fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies (as <hi>Noah</hi> in the manſions of the Ark) until time, and they be tranſient, and paſs into eternity.</p>
            <p>The firſt means in a Type that freed the groaning Creation, and the earth (filled with violence) from violence and the curſe of bondage; was the coming of the freed creatures (as it were by their families) into their manſions in the Ark.</p>
            <p>The ſecond typical means that freed the Creation and the free people of God, was the coming of all Iſrael, and ſealing of them (by their families) in their own houſes.</p>
            <p>The third means of efficacy and truth, that ſhall deliver the burdened earth (filled with violence) and the Creation and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or God (groaning under it,) ſhall be by the coming of the true Iſrael into their own Manſions myſtical by their anti-typical Tribes and Families: God ſealed, that is, ſhut in the creatures,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:32682:63"/>delivered from deſtruction, in the Ark, by their Tribes and Kinds. God ſealed all <hi>Iſrael</hi> (delivered from <hi>Egypts</hi> bondage) with the blood of a Lamb, the Signe of the life of righteouſneſs; and ſhut them in their own houſes by their Families, and God will ſeale all his ſervants the true Iſrael with the Seale of the living God (the blood of the Lamb <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>When the Creatures in the Ark (delivered from deſtruction) were ſhut in, then was the beginning of a new policy, or City, and of a new Heaven, and a new earth in a Type.

And when the true Iſrael ſhall come into, and ſhall be ſealed, and ſhut in (as the Creatures in the Ark were in, and by their manſions, and Families myſtical, then, and there ſhall be a reall beginning of a new policy, or City (Oeconomick, Civil, and Eccleſiaſtical) and of a new Heaven, and of a new Earth (in Anti-type and truth) Impreſſe, and intenſe acts of charitable civilities (in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage) are dead carkaſſes of righteouſneſs (as the Law is a dead carkaſs, or letter) Therefore they are juſt, good and lawful (as a carkaſs, or body of righteouſneſs) but (as the Law is the ſtrength of ſin by occaſion) ſo are they (by occaſion) the ſtrength of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, ſin, and death; for they being dead to righteouſneſs of Freedom, live in, and unto the life, and power of bondage, and are the ſtrength of it; as a ſtrong Caſtle is his ſtrength that keeps it, or as a ſtrong and healthful body liveth in, and unto the ſoul, and is the ſtrength of it. Impreſs, and intenſe righteouſneſs of bondage (reliefe, and ſupport, from and againſt the evils of it, without righteouſneſs of Freedom out of it) is like <hi>Sions</hi> ſtrong Tower in the <hi>Iebuſits</hi> hands, which deceives and hardens their hearts that extend it, deſtroys their lives, Families, and eſtates, and is ſo far from all righteouſneſs of Freedom, that it ratifies, and fortifies an oppoſit habit of ſpurious, and impoſturous deceits againſt all perfect and legitimate righteouſneſs of Freedom, it ſtirs them up to ſay Soul, Soul, take thine eaſe, thou haſt many parcels of good words (and works too) of releif, ſupport, and

            <p>Nothing ſo diſpleaſed God as the ſpirit of apoſtacy, and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very in his people, in looking back unto the houſe of bondage, the land of their deſtruction, after they were delivered out of it. The Free people of God (indeed) muſt, and will (conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) preſs forward in the power of perfect and legitimate righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Freedom, and follow after (<hi>Rev</hi> 14.4.) <hi>and be led by the Lamb whereſoever he goeth.</hi> I have (herein as in the ſight of God) diſcharged my Faith. Faithfulneſs reapes (what it doth not ſow) deſtruction to thoſe that are Faithful: but this God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth. The ſequel to my ſelf, whether love or hatred, bonds, or liberty, life, or death, I leave to God, it is ſufficient for me, If I may by all meanes diſcharge my duty, and diſoblige my Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
